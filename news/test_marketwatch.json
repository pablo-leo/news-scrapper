        "body": "Santa Claus had barely hung up his boots after delivering his namesake rally to good little stock-market investors, then all hell broke loose.\nThe past week saw big market swings as investors rung in the first week of trading in 2022, and market watchers pointed to the prospect of more volatility as they grapple with the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to fight inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\n\u201cI think markets are trying to figure out how aggressive the\u00a0Fed will be in removing accommodation and tightening and if it possibly will make a policy mistake,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, in a phone interview.\nThe release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Dec. 14-15 policy meeting on Wednesday stoked the uncertainty. They revealed that policy makers had discussed being more aggressive in raising rates than previously anticipated and had talked about the possibility of beginning to shrink the size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet more quickly than they had done when they ended an earlier round of quantitative easing spurred by the financial crisis.\nThat added fuel to a bond-market selloff that saw the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.792% jump by more than 27 basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, over the past week, the largest such rise since September 2019. At 1.769%, the rate is the highest since Jan. 17, 2020.\nAhead of the minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.56% and had risen 2.4% in the final five trading days of 2021 and the first two of 2022 \u2014 the stretch that defines the so-called Santa Claus rally. For the Dow, it was the strongest run for the seasonal phenomenon since 2008-09, when it rose more than 6%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.08% gained 1.4% courtesy of St. Nick, its strongest such run since 2012-13.\nBut the jump in yields did no favors to tech and other rate-sensitive growth stocks, which had already began to suffer last month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.59% had missed out on the Santa rally altogether, falling 0.2%. On Wednesday it tanked more than 3% for its worst one-day performance since February.\nValuations for growth companies are based on expected cash flows far into the future. Higher interest rates mean that cash isn\u2019t as valuable as it was when rates were lower.\nThe Dow and S&P 500 also suffered, and all three major indexes ended the week with losses, though the Dow and S&P 500 remain just 1.5% and 2.5% off record levels finishes set on Jan. 4 and Jan. 3, respectively. Crypto traders also appeared rattled by the minutes, with bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.49% sliding to a three-month low, leaving the world\u2019s biggest digital asset with its worst start to a calendar year since 2014.\nValue stocks beat their growth counterparts in the first week of 2022, extending outperformance seen in December. The Russell 1000 Value index RLV, -0.17% rose 0.8% over the past week, while the Russell 1000 Growth index RLG, +0.24% fell 4.8%, according to FactSet data. In December, the Russell 1000 Value index climbed 6.1%, for its biggest monthly gain since November 2020, to surpass the Russell 1000 Growth\u2019s advance of 2.1%.\nRead: Value stocks have pulled ahead of growth in recent weeks. Is it a head-fake?\nAt the sector level, tech fell 4.7% in the past week, while deep-value cyclical sectors jumped, noted Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco. Financials jumped 5.6%, while energy soared more than 10%. And the defensive consumer-staples sector managed a rise of around 0.4%.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean investors should rush off to chase the rotation, he said, in a note.\n\u201cBasically, we see the Fed tapping the brakes by guiding interest rates higher and flattening the yield curve to restrain an overheating U.S. economy. In that context, we think it\u2019s too soon to rotate into deep-value cyclicals, which would likely require a steepening yield curve and an economic reacceleration,\u201d Levitt said.\nAbsent an economic recession, the timing is also likely wrong for investors to load up on defensive stock sectors, he said, as they\u2019re unlikely to outperform meaningfully until the end of the current market cycle.\nQMA\u2019s Keon doesn\u2019t expect the Fed to overdo it, but cautions that it\u2019s a non-negligible risk as policy makers grapple with the inflationary aftermath of a $5 trillion fiscal stimulus and the central bank\u2019s own aggressive actions on the monetary-policy front.\nThe shift from an environment of free-flowing liquidity to one in which policy makers are closing the spigots and draining liquidity doesn\u2019t preclude positive returns for equities and other risky assets, he said, but one doesn\u2019t have to be bold to expect more subdued gains after the S&P 500 posted annual price rises of 28.9% in 2019, 16.3% in 2020 and 26.9% in 2021.\nFor his part, Keon expects inflation to subside as supply-chain bottlenecks ease. Economic growth may see a first-quarter hiccup due to the omicron variant, improving in the second quarter as investors wait to gauge what\u2019s sustainable for late 2022-2023.\nRising yields aren\u2019t necessarily a negative for stocks \u2014 after all, a stronger economy should lead to higher rates \u2014 but they are a bigger relative headwind for growth stocks. Keon said he doesn\u2019t expect value to \u201ccrush\u201d growth in the year ahead, but the stage may be set for a more \u201cbalanced\u201d market, rather than one marked by narrow leadership.\nA much weaker-than-expected rise in December nonfarm payrolls on Friday did nothing to quell upward pressure on yields, with investors instead focusing on an unemployment rate that unexpectedly dropped to 3.9% from 4.2%, while average hourly earnings showed a strong rise. \n\u201cA 4.7% gain in annual hourly earnings, coupled with a drop in the unemployment rate to a fresh pandemic low of 3.9%, is a clear sign of a tight labor market if ever there was one, and will likely give the Fed a green light for monetary tightening,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, in emailed comments.\nSee: Traders, undeterred by December\u2019s lousy job gains, continue to price in `sooner and faster\u2019 tightening by Federal Reserve\n The December jobs report \u201cis not going to take the steam out of bond yields, nor is the headline payrolls number strong enough to reassure markets of a very strong economy,\u201d Shah wrote. \u201cEquity markets are on the line for a volatile month.\u201d"

        "body": "How risky is the office compared to everywhere else during the pandemic?\nDid anyone actually give a 50-year-old federal agency \u2014 the government\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration \u2014 the legal ability to create COVID-19 vaccination-or-testing rules that could affect 84 million private sector workers?\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday issued a ruling that stopped the Biden administration from enforcing a requirement that employees at large businesses be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask on the job. However, the judges are allowing the government to proceed with a vaccine mandate for most health care workers in the U.S.\nIf those rules had taken effect on Monday, Jan. 10, another question hovered over the Supreme Court proceedings: Would such a mandate blunt the sky-high rise in new COVID-19 infections from the omicron variant, or lead to an exodus of workers who refuse to be subjected to vaccination requirements?\nThose were some of the key questions U.S. Supreme Court justices grappled with last week in arguments on the federal government\u2019s vaccination-or-test mandate for businesses with at least 100 workers. \nWhen it came to the disputed OSHA rules, business associations and Republican-leaning states wanted an immediate stay. They say OSHA is venturing far outside its powers with a mandate that will cause businesses to hemorrhage staff and money for compliance costs.\nOn the other side of the argument, the Biden administration says this moment is exactly what the OSHA was built for: Coming up with rules to protect workers when they go to work. \nHowever, the Supreme Court begged to differ. \u201cOSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID\u201319 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here,\u201d the court\u2019s conservative majority wrote in an unsigned opinion.\nThree-quarters\u00a0of employers polled in one recent survey said they\u2019d only go ahead with a vaccine requirement if the OSHA rules stood up in court. In a different survey, roughly\u00a0one-third of businesses\u00a0said if they\u2019d only apply the mandate if required by law.\nHere are three themes that emerged during last week\u2019s arguments:\nOSHA unveiled its rules requiring either vaccination or weekly testing in early November, weeks before anyone had ever heard of the omicron variant, a highly transmissible but \u2014 thus far \u2014 less severe COVID-19 mutation. \nThe U.S. recorded an average of 781,203 new COVID-19 infections, up 159% over a two-week period, according to a New York Times case tracker. Hospitalizations were up 82% from two weeks prior at 145,005.\n\u201cIs that what you are doing now? To say to the public interest in this situation to stop this vaccination rule, with nearly a million people, let me not exaggerate, nearly three-quarters of a million people, new cases every day?\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer asked the lawyer representing businesses who want the court to stay the rules. \u201cI mean, to me, I would find that unbelievable.\u201d\n\u201cJustice Breyer, we are asking for a stay before enforcement takes effect Monday, and the reason for that is this is an unprecedented agency action,\u201d said attorney Scott Keller, representing the business groups.\nBreyer \u2014 generally associated with the court\u2019s liberal wing \u2014 kept up the questioning, sounding incredulous. \u201cThis is going to cause a massive economic shift in the country, billions upon billions of non-recoverable costs. Testing is also not frequently available,\u201d Keller responded.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration came into being when President Richard Nixon signed a 1970 law that created the agency one year later.\nDecades later, Prelogar told the court that countering workplace risk from infectious disease was \u201cin the heartland of OSHA\u2019s authority.\u201d While opponents of the mandate say Congress needs to authorize COVID-19 mandates now, Prelogar said the court just had to look at the wording of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\nBut a lot of time has passed since that act became law, Chief Justice John Roberts said.\n\u201cThat was 50 years ago that you\u2019re saying Congress acted. I don\u2019t think it had COVID in mind. That was almost closer to the Spanish Flu than it is to today\u2019s problem,\u201d he said. \nWith the slew of other federal agency vaccine requirements \u2014 like the one for health care workers and federal contractors \u2014- \u201cit seems to me the government is trying to work across the waterfront, and go agency by agency\u201d instead of through Congress, Roberts, generally perceived as a conservative judge, said.\nIf OSHA has the power, why not mandate polio and flu vaccines in workplaces too, Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative-leaning judge, asked. The size and scope of the COVID pandemic put it at a different plane, Prelogar said. \nJudges pressed the mandate opponents on the purpose of OSHA too. \nIf the agency can\u2019t protect workers from unsafe settings, what is it there for, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, identified broadly as a liberal-leaning member of the court, wondered at another point in the arguments. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between this and telling employers where sparks are flying in the workplace, your workers have to wear a mask?\u201d\n\u201cWhen sparks are flying in the workplace, that\u2019s presumably because there\u2019s a machine that\u2019s unique to that workplace,\u201d Keller, representing the business associations, responded.\n\u201cWhy is the human being not like a machine if it\u2019s spewing a virus?\u201d Sotomayor asked.\nThe OSHA mandate is \u201ca blunderbuss rule nationwide in scope,\u201d said Benjamin Flowers, Ohio\u2019s solicitor general, arguing on behalf of states opposed to the mandate. He spoke remotely last Friday because he recently tested positive for COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 is \u201ca danger we all simply face as a matter of waking up in the morning,\u201d he said. So this isn\u2019t a special workplace threat where OSHA should step in with a sweeping mandate, he said.\nJustice Elena Kagan, regarded as a moderate member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, saw it differently. Think about something like a baseball game, she noted. A person can decide to go to the game, and they can decide who they\u2019ll go with if they want to go.\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t do any of that in workplaces. You have to be there, you have to be there for eight hours a day,\u201d she said. A worker has to deal with the same setting and work with the same people, \u201cwho might be completely irresponsible. Where else do people have a greater risk than at the workplace?\u201d\nAt another point, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court\u2019s conservative enclave, noted that not all jobs are created equal. The infection dangers for some are far greater, like people working at a meatpacking plant. Were businesses arguing some rules are necessary \u2014 but that the focus has to be tighter, she asked?\n\u201cWherever that line is, [the OSHA regulation] is so far beyond that line,\u201d Keller said.\nIn their commentary issued Thursday, the Supreme Court\u2019s three liberal judges disagreed. \u201cActing outside of its competence and without legal basis, the Court displaces the judgments of the Government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies,\u201d Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a joint dissent.\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)"

        "body": "The pandemic keeps grinding on, and the number of bankruptcies keep plummeting \u2014 at least for now.\nConsumers who were over their head in debt and distressed businesses submitted 434,540 bankruptcy filings through September, according to a report on the federal court system from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\nThat\u2019s an almost 30% drop from the 612,561 bankruptcy cases filed at the same point in 2020. And even that number was also lower than the 776,674 bankruptcy cases filed in 2019, the report added.\nEven before the pandemic, bankruptcy cases in recent years were already well off the high numbers during the Great Recession. There were approximately 1.6 million cases in the first nine months of 2010.\nMost bankruptcy cases are filed by consumers, the report noted. Cases can give a person a fresh financial start after they enter a court-supervised plan to pay back creditors via repayment plans or liquidated assets.\n\u201cIncreased government benefits\u201d throughout the year \u2014 such as third round $1,400 stimulus checks, supplemental jobless benefits and monthly child tax credit payments \u2014 were one reason for the drop, the report said. \nSo were eviction moratoriums, including a now-lapsed federal halt on evictions. The year-end report also pointed to \u201cstate lockdown orders that decreased personal expenditures.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018There are many forces that are pushing people to not file bankruptcy right now and definitely throughout 2021.\u2019\u201d \nAs of November, there were 369,690 cumulative bankruptcy filings in the 50 states and Washington D.C., according to separate American Bankruptcy Institute data. By the same point last year, there were 523, 917 cases filed.\nAre these numbers a sign of the benefits from stimulus checks and monthly child tax credit payments? Or a sign of a rebounding economy during a job-seekers market? If so, should that raise concern for 2022 as more government aid goes away?\n\u201cThere are many forces that are pushing people to not file bankruptcy right now and definitely throughout 2021,\u201d said Professor Pamela Foohey, a consumer bankruptcy expert teaching at Yeshiva University\u2019s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.\nBefore bankruptcy, Foohey said it can take people around two years of financial struggle that ends with a crisis like an eviction notice. But it\u2019s unclear when the clock on that struggle might be occurring in the current context, she added.\nWithout Congressional action, the last enhanced child tax credit came and went on Dec. 15. The pause on federal student loan payments runs through May 1. Meanwhile, inflation keeps running hot and hurting American spending power.\nExcluding mortgages, household debt balances for obligations like auto loans, credit cards and student loans rose by $61 billion to $4.25 trillion in the third quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nShe just doesn\u2019t know to what extent that translates into bankruptcy cases. \u201cPeople want to pay their bills and want to be financially secure, and they put off filing bankruptcy in the hope they will become financially secure,\u201d she said.\n\u201c2022 could be the year of financial reckoning where people start having to pay more on their debts,\u201d Foohey said."
