        "body": "U.S. stock benchmarks, led by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ended sharply higher Friday, as investors who were cautious about buying at the onset of the military clash in Eastern Europe turned eager to hunt down bargains. \nThe upbeat tone on the markets was tied, at least in part, to reports that Russia was in favor of talks with Ukrainian leadership. However, Moscow\u2019s military force was on display as it pressed toward the capital of Ukraine.\n For more: Complete MarketWatch coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine \nOn Thursday, the Dow snapped a five-session losing streak, closing up 92.07 points, or 0.3%, at 33,223.83, after falling as far as 2.6% in morning trading. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite\u00a0rose 3.3%, also erasing a huge tumble.\nStocks gained altitude on the back of news reports indicating that Russia was ready to conduct negotiations with Ukraine, citing a summary of a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping provided by China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\nHowever, the reports came as Russian forces were closing in on Ukrainian capital Kyiv, which had been under fire earlier Friday.\nFriday afternoon, the White House said that the U.S. will join the European Union in directly sanctioning Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and members of the Russian national security team, over the invasion of Ukraine.\nTalk of new more direct penalties for Moscow comes after President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0on Thursday announced a fresh wave of Russia sanctions, in an attempt to isolate Moscow from the global economy. \nSo far, however, the White House and its allies have spared Russia\u2019s oil exports and avoided blocking access to the SWIFT global payment network.\n\u201cThe latest Western sanctions\u00a0on Russia\u00a0will hit its economy hard through tighter financial conditions and reduced trade, and might plausibly hit GDP by 1-2%-pts,\u201d William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in note. \u201cBut sanctions stopped short of the more damaging scenario \u2014 both for Russia and Europe \u2014 in which Russia\u2019s energy exports are targeted. For most countries, the main economic impact of the crisis will come through higher commodity prices and the impact on inflation.\u201d\nSee: Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden\u2019s Supreme Court pick, once sided with Trump on his border wall\nInvestors might be hoping that the Ukrainian crisis could slow moves by central banks to raise interest rates to combat inflation, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote Bank SA, in a note. But \u201cthe only certainty is uncertainty, and this is how it will be for the next couple of sessions unfortunately,\u201d he said. \nCrude-oil prices came off Thursday\u2019s highs after rising above $100 a barrel during intraday trading for the first time since 2014. \nNeed to Know: Why the energy shock from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine won\u2019t wreck the stock market\nLarry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, said by phone Friday that he\u2019ll be watching for signs of potentially higher commodity prices stemming from Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine. For example, consumer spending could be hurt should gas prices in the U.S. rise to an aggregate average of more than $4 a gallon, he said. But the U.S. economy \u201cremains strong,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumer spending remains resilient.\u201d\nU.S. economic data released Friday showed Americans sharply increased spending by 2.1% in January, exceeding expectations. Spending had fallen in December for the first time in 10 months amid fears surrounding the omicron variant of the coronavirus.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve\u2019s favorite inflation calculator rose by 0.6% in January and showed the biggest yearly increase since 1982, underscoring why the central bank is poised to raise interest rates for the first time in four years.\nIn other economic data, orders for durable goods rose 1.6% in January,\u00a0the government said Friday. Economists had forecast a 0.8% rise in orders for durable goods \u2014 products made to last at least three years. \nBusiness spending is \u201cvery strong,\u201d said Adam. \nA final reading of U.S. consumer sentiment for February from the University of Michigan rose slightly to 62.8. The index registered 61.7 earlier in the month after a preliminary survey, marking the lowest level in more than 10 years.\nAlso, U.S. pending home sales fell a sharp 5.7% in January, according to a monthly index released by the National Association of Realtors on Friday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected pending home sales to rise 1%.\n\u2014Clive McKeef contributed to this article."

        "body": "Are today\u2019s boom towns at risk of going bust?\nA new report from researchers at Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University examined which housing markets nationwide are most overvalued. Using third-party data, the researchers calculated the average property price in each of the 100 largest housing markets nationwide, and compare the fluctuations in prices with what would be expected based on their historic growth. Based on that comparison, they determine how over- or undervalued a market is.\nAs of January, the premiums homes fetched had increased in every one of the markets studied, but one market far surpassed the rest. Boise, Idaho, ranked as the most overvalued housing market nationwide, with buyers paying a roughly 76% premium for those who wished to purchase a home there.\nBoise has experienced a dramatic rollercoaster ride over the past few years. Before the pandemic, it was hailed as one of the hottest housing markets in the country as it began to attract transplants from pricey West Coast markets like San Francisco and Seattle. Those buyers were attracted to the cheap home prices, stunning scenery and close proximity to those tech hubs.\nBut over time, Boise\u2019s competitive advantage has ebbed as home prices surged with this bumper demand. A similar story has played out in the No. 2 most-overvalued city on the ranking, as well: Austin, Texas, where buyers are paying a 62% premium. Here are the top 10 overvalued housing markets, according to the report:\nSome pricey markets have seen their fates improve recently, the researchers noted. In particular, they explain that places like San Francisco and Los Angeles were seeing \u201cpricing crowns\u201d develop, suggesting they were moving toward a downturn. But in most of these markets, prices have resumed their steady upward climb.\nWhile there was no market nationwide that was undervalued based on these metric, the places where home buyers will pay the smallest premium to lock up a property are Honolulu (0.5%), Baltimore (0.7%) and New York (1.7%).\n \u201c\u2018If you lock in a home price now, it could take years to see the return on that investment.\u2019\u201d \nGiven how overvalued the nation\u2019s housing stock is, the researchers advised buyers to exercise caution. \u201cWe encourage buyers to negotiate aggressively or to consider renting, even in light of the recent surge in rental rates,\u201d Eli Beracha, director of\u00a0Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University and one of the report\u2019s co-authors, said in the study.\n\u201cIf you lock in a home price now, it could take years to see the return on that investment,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cTemporarily high monthly rent could be viewed as the cost of avoiding the vagrancies of an irrationally exuberant housing market.\u201d\nThe researchers pointed to Miami as an example for their argument. During the market\u2019s peak in late 2006, buyers there paid nearly $340,000 on average to purchase a home. Only now are many of those buyers able to sell their home for a profit, they said based on their analysis.\n\u201cWith the dramatic fluctuations that we\u2019re seeing now, wealth creation through housing is not guaranteed, making homeownership a sometimes-risky investment,\u201d Ken Johnson, an economist with Florida Atlantic University and the report\u2019s second co-author, said in the study."

        "body": "Home buyers are seeing temporary relief from rising interest rates as markets react to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But in the longer term, inflation remains a serious concern.\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.89% for the week ending Feb. 24, down three basis points from the previous week, Freddie Mac\u00a0 FMCC, +1.59% reported Thursday. The slight decline marks a retreat from the highest benchmark mortgage rates in years.\nAnd there\u2019s a chance rates will move even higher. As the U.S. and other countries move to impose sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, gas prices are likely to surge due to Russia\u2019s position as a major producer of oil and natural gas.\n\u201cAn extended war in Eastern Europe could lead to higher global energy prices and higher U.S. inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively, and higher\u00a0interest\u00a0rates\u00a0could become a larger headwind for the U.S. economy,\u201d said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher.\n\u201cEven with this week\u2019s decline, mortgage rates have increased more than a full percent over the last six months,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in the report.\n \u201c\u2018An extended war in Eastern Europe could lead to higher global energy prices and higher U.S. inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively.\u2019\u201d \nThe 15-year fixed-rate mortgage fell one basis point over the past week to an average of 3.14%. The 5-year Treasury-indexed adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 2.98%, unchanged from the previous week.\nThe decline in mortgage rates roughly tracks movements in long-term bond yields. The 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.968% has slid in recent days as tensions in Eastern Europe exploded into armed conflict. \n\u201cAs the world reacts to developments in Ukraine, the uncertainty will likely mean a pause in the recent pace of increases,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.\nBut even with this momentary pause, mortgage rates remain significantly higher than in recent months. According to Hale, only two previous events compare with this recent surge in rates. Following the 2016 presidential election, mortgage rates soared 85 basis points over 10 weeks, and in 2013 during the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d when the Federal Reserve scaled back its stimulus activities interest rates increased by more than 1% over 11 weeks\u2019 time.\n\u201cIn both cases, home sales momentum slowed in the following year due to the impact on affordability, since rising\u00a0rates\u00a0mean higher homeownership costs even if home prices are unchanged,\u201d Hale said, noting the effects were more pronounced for those who had less money to put toward a down payment.\nIt remains to be seen whether a similar string of events will occur in 2022, though signs point in that direction. Recent mortgage-application data from the Mortgage Bankers Association suggests that home-buying demand has ebbed in the face of rising rates. \nBruce Kasman, JPMorgan\u2019s chief economist, told CNBC that the Russian invasion of the Ukraine makes the Federal Reserve\u2019s position more complicated. \u201cThere is a scenario where the growth hit starts to get more substantial. There\u2019s also scenarios where the price increases are not as damaging to growth and it\u2019s feeding inflation.\u201d"

(Not to mention the astronomical price tag.)\nThere\u2019s no debating the fact that it\u2019s an expensive ride (er, hotel stay). A family of four will pay about $6,000 for the experience \u2014 with lodging, meals and entertainment included, according to press reports. (A \u201ctricked-out\u201d suite will run around $20,000, according to the New York Times.)\nThe cost doesn\u2019t include alcoholic drinks \u2014 a beer will run $13.50, the Times noted \u2014 or fun extras like \u201cStar Wars\u201d-themed clothing items from the gift shop. \nThe idea behind the Galactic Starcruiser experience is that you\u2019re boarding, well, a \u201cStar Wars\u201d starcruiser \u2014 specifically, the Halcyon, which is billed by Disney as \u201ca vessel known for its impeccable service and exotic destinations.\u201d The \u201cship\u201d is really a hotel with 100 cabins, but those who have been aboard note that you do get a galaxy \u201cview\u201d via video monitors that take the place of windows.\nAnd you get to interact with a whole range of \u201cStar Wars\u201d characters (Chewbacca, Kylo Ren, et al), as well as hang out at a space-age bar (dubbed the Sublight Lounge) and eat all sorts of food with an out-of-this-world theme (blue shrimp, anyone?).

        "body": "It\u2019s fairly common knowledge that your Social Security benefits can be taxed on your income tax return. The problem is understanding how the tax is applied. It can be complicated, and can result in some significant tax increases if you\u2019re not paying attention.\nThe Social Security taxation cliff is called so because at certain income levels, adding even one dollar of additional income can result in a serious increase in tax. Social Security benefits can be included as taxable at a rate of 85%, 50%, or even zero, depending on your other income.\nRead more Social Security news and advice on MarketWatch Retirement\nBriefly, when you add all of your non-Social Security income (including nontaxed items such as U.S. savings bond interest and municipal bond interest, as well as your IRA deduction if you happen to contribute) to half of your Social Security benefit for the year, this results in a number that the IRS calls \u201cprovisional income\u201d \u2013 we\u2019ll call it PI for short. (Here\u2019s a link to a more detailed review of the\u00a0taxation of Social Security benefits.)\nWhen your PI is less than $32,000 (for married couples filing jointly) or $25,000 for single and head of household filers, then none of your Social Security benefit is included as taxable. Once you go above this initial threshold, a portion of your Social Security benefit will be included as taxable income, firstly at a 50% rate. This 50% rate applies up to the second threshold, coming up next.\nIf your PI is above $44,000 (married filing jointly) or $34,000 (single or head of household), now a portion of your Social Security benefit will be included at the 85% rate. At a certain point, the 85% rate will apply to your full Social Security benefit, meaning 85% of your Social Security benefit will be included in your taxable income for the year.\nSo what\u2019s the cliff?\nFirst of all, it\u2019s a bit of a misnomer, because a cliff implies a one-time change to altitude. The Social Security taxation thresholds indeed do change your tax altitude, but it\u2019s not a one-time change. Gradually as income increases above the threshold(s), more and more of your Social Security benefit is included as taxable income.\nHere is an example to illustrate:\nMeg and Johnny are a married couple receiving Social Security benefits in the amount of $16,000 per year. They also receive a total of $40,000 in retirement funds, from pensions or IRA withdrawals. To keep things simple, they have no nontaxed income to include in their calculations. Below is an illustration of how the Social Security benefit is taxed in their situation.\nAs you can see, since Meg and Johnny\u2019s PI is above the second threshold just a bit, a portion of their Social Security benefit is included at the 50% rate (line 7) and a portion is included at the 85% rate. Altogether, their Social Security benefit is included as taxable income at a rate of 58.75%.\nNow we come to the cliff concept. When you approach a cliff, you\u2019re fine until you take that next step. Same with Social Security taxation \u2014 let\u2019s say Meg and Johnny decide to withdraw an additional $1,000 from their IRA this year. Below is how the calculation will play out with this seemingly minor addition:\nThis addition to income has increased their Social Security taxability rate to 64%, where before it was included at 58.75%.\nIncreasing their overall income for the year by the $1,000 additional withdrawal results in an increase to their adjusted gross income by $1,850. Normally in this situation, without the Social Security taxation issue, increasing income by $1,000 for this couple would only increase their tax by $120 (using 2022 tax tables). But Meg and Johnny actually have an increase of $222, so that $1,000 withdrawal has cost them 22.2% in taxes.\nIn a similar fashion, if Meg and Johnny were able to reduce their PI by $1,000, this would decrease their taxable Social Security benefit to $8,550, or only 53.34% included.\nWhat can you do about it?\nFirst of all, understand that this situation only occurs in the limited PI ranges between $32,000 and roughly $50,000 to $60,000 (for married filing jointly). For Meg and Johnny, their Social Security benefits become fully 85% included as taxable when their PI is above approximately $53,000. For singles and heads of household the range is between $25,000 and approximately $40,000. If your PI is below those thresholds, you have zero includable Social Security income as taxable. Above the upper range, and your Social Security benefit will be 85% included as taxable income.\nIf you\u2019re in the middle somewhere, you might want to pay close attention to how your benefit is taxed. If you can control your income somewhat, you could bunch some income in one year (and take the tax hit), making the following year (or the prior year) a more lean income year.\nIf IRA Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) are the culprit taking you up over the threshold(s), you might consider doing a Roth conversion in order to bring down the amount of your RMD. A systematic Roth conversion strategy prior to actually starting to receive Social Security benefits might pay off very well by reducing your included Social Security benefits.\nJust keep in mind that doing Roth conversions can impact other income-related items, such as Medicare premiums."

        "body": "Inflation is hitting Burger King chicken nuggets.\nCarrols Restaurant Group, the largest Burger King franchisor in the U.S., is taking steps to combat commodity inflation, including reducing the number of nuggets in a meal.\n\u201cAs you may have recently read, the Burger King brand has about a dozen menu and promotional initiatives, some of which have already been implemented and some that will be implemented over the course of this year,\u201d said Daniel Accordino, chief executive of Carrols, on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\u201cRecent actions in this regard from our franchisor[s] include lifting price caps on value menu items and reducing the number of nuggets [in] meals from 10 pieces to 8. The Whopper, the brand\u2019s most popular product by a wide margin, has also been removed as a core discount item and is no longer available in the two-for-six or two-for-five promotions.\u201d\nSee: Nitro Pepsi, a creamy cola that leaves a frothy mustache, launches March 28\nCarrols detailed the commodity inflation that the company is facing, with beef, which makes up a quarter of its food basket, up 33% over last year.\nCarrols is also facing labor inflation, with the company raising average hourly wages by 14% year-over-year as it tried to maintain open hours from 6am to 11pm while competing to hire and retain workers.\n\u201cDomestic food, paper producers and distributors supplying most of our commodities are dealing with labor constraints, along with higher fuel costs and are passing the increases on to us. As a result, commodity inflation overall was approximately 16% this past quarter compared to the prior year period,\u201d Accordino said.\n\u201cWhile we cannot predict when these inflationary cost pressures will end, we can say that we believe that in the back half of 2022, the year-over-year percentage increases for labor and commodity costs will moderate. We also intend to continue to move pricing to partially offset inflation to the extent possible without impacting traffic.\u201d\nAnd: Kraft Heinz and TheNotCompany joint venture will focus on plant-based foods\nCarrolls reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16.4 million, or 33 cents per share, after a loss of $18.6 million, or 37 cents per share, last year. An adjusted loss of 15 cents per share was narrower than the FactSet consensus for a loss of 25 cents per share.\nSales totaled $416.1 million, down from $420.5 million and just ahead of the FactSet consensus for $415.8 million.\nCarrols operates 1,028 Burger King restaurants across 23 states, and 65 Popeyes restaurants in seven states.\nComparable restaurant sales at Burger King rose 7.4% for the quarter, and were up 1% at Popeyes.\nAccordino called January 2022 a \u201cchallenging month\u201d with snowstorms in major markets and omicron-related staffing issues driving down Burger King comparable sales by 1.4%. February, on the other hand, has been \u201cpromising.\u201d\nIn addition to challenges tied to inflation and weather, Carrols is undergoing a change in leadership, with the company announcing a new chief executive effective April 1.\nAlso: Carrols names McDonald\u2019s vet as CEO\n\u201cCarrols is taking significant menu pricing (~8%), but has been careful to align price actions with competitors, limiting the risk of overshooting,\u201d wrote Truist in a note.\n\u201d Inflationary pressures are muting margins, but we expect a moderation in 2H22, driving margin expansion.\u201d\nTruist rates Carrols stock buy with a $6 price target.\nBurger King and Popeyes are both part of the Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, +1.71% lineup. Restaurant Brands reported fourth quarter profit and sales that beat expectations earlier this month.\nCarrols stock was down 1.2% on Thursday, and has slumped 59.3% over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +2.24% has gained 8.4% over the last 12 months."

Instead of recommending that people mask up if they live in communities with substantial or high transmission \u2014 criteria that covered about 95% of U.S. counties \u2014\u00a0the agency now factors in hospitalization rates and local hospital capacity, which have improved since the omicron surge, along with case counts.\nThe agency\u2019s new county-level map tool showing \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d COVID-19 risk has more than 70% of the U.S. population living in counties deemed to be at low or medium risk, where people can stop masking up, the Associated Press reported. \nIndoor masking in public places is still recommended for people in high-risk areas. The agency added that people can choose to mask at any time, and people who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, have symptoms or test positive for the virus should wear masks.\nDaniel McQuillen, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said Friday that the organization supports the CDC\u2019s new mask guidance. \u201cThe change in guidance\u00a0reflects the high level of protection that vaccines offer against serious disease and death while recognizing that protections may remain in place in settings where spread is more likely such as health care or large congregate settings,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cCDC\u00a0will\u00a0continue to track transmissions\u00a0to\u00a0foreshadow changes to\u00a0these local\u00a0hospitalization rates\u00a0and update the guidance if and where it becomes necessary,\u201d he added. \u201cTracking transmission rates will be especially important so that immunocompromised individuals or others at risk of serious disease can remain informed and take measures to protect themselves.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018The change in guidance\u00a0reflects the high level of protection that vaccines offer against serious disease.\u2019\u201d \nStill, Blackstock was not the only person to raise the alarm on social media about what loosening mask guidance might mean for vulnerable individuals, including people with compromised immune systems, who may not receive strong protection from COVID-19 vaccines, and children younger than 5, who still aren\u2019t eligible for vaccination.\nMillions of people in the U.S. have diseases that affect the immune system, and still more take drugs that suppress their immune system.\n\u201cI won\u2019t take off my mask indoors no matter what the CDC says today,\u201d Dr. Kim Sue, an addiction physician and anthropologist and the medical director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition, tweeted Friday morning. \u201cThis is not about me, it\u2019s about all my neighbors, immunocompromised friends, children \n\u201cTomorrow, @CDCDirector will announce @CDCgov is largely abandoning the most effective non-pharmaceutical intervention we have against #COVID19. Just as severely immuncompromised [sic] Americans are told there\u2019s not nearly enough #EvuSheld to protect them,\u201d tweeted Matthew Cortland, a lawyer and senior resident fellow at the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress, on Thursday.\nCortland was referring to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s recent move to double the recommended dosage for Evusheld, an antibody cocktail authorized for use in people who are immunocompromised or can\u2019t be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to a history of severe allergic reaction. Journalists have reported that this essentially halves the already scarce supply of doses.\nCDC director Rochelle Walensky tweeted Thursday that the agency had been analyzing its COVID-19 data and is \u201cshifting our focus to preventing the most severe outcomes and minimizing healthcare strain.\u201d\n\u201cOverall risk of severe disease due to #COVID19 is generally lower with widespread population immunity through vaccination, boosters & prior infection,\u201d she wrote, adding that the country now has tools like testing, high-quality masks, more treatments and improved ventilation in its arsenal.\n\u201cStill, #COVID19 continues to circulate in communities,\u201d Walensky wrote. \u201cMoving forward, our approach will advise enhanced prevention efforts in communities with a high volume of severe illness and will also focus on protecting our healthcare systems from being overwhelmed.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with the CDC\u2019s announcement."

Add to that, financial markets seem to flinch on the barest thread of information.\nExperts from the left-leaning Center for a New American Security held a seminar in Washington on Friday trying to answer the questions everyone is asking.\nRussian troops seem to have tried at the start to head for the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, hoping to decapitate the government. The Russian army is not using nearly as much firepower as might be expected. This strategy was optimistic and does not seemed to have worked, and Russia is going to have to adjust. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re settling in for a lot of heavy fighting and a war that\u2019s likely going to drag on,\u201d said Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies program at CNA. The big picture doesn\u2019t look good for the Ukrainian military. The big question is whether insurgency will form in the big cities, where urban warfare can level the playing field. \nProtests took place in 62 cities in Russia, a much larger turnout than expected, said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the transatlantic security program at CNA. There were over 1,000 arrests. The unprovoked war might trigger a sense of injustice that could spread opposition, she said. So it is something to watch. The elite are not likely to turn against Putin, she added. \u201cPutin has so tied the fate of all of these individuals to him that I think they dare not defect,\u201d she said.\nMarkets were heartened on Friday by talk of potential negotiations between the two sides. The experts said there was less there than met the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t think the prospects [for negotiations] are particularly good,\u201d said Jeffrey Edmonds, a senior research scientist at CNA. \nThe endgame is very hard to understand because the only person who seems to know the answer is Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kendall-Taylor said it is plausible that there will be a long-term partition of Ukraine. She said that Putin might be \u201cplaying for keeps\u201d and become a \u201cgatherer of the land\u201d like czars of old, annexing large swaths of Belarus and Ukraine."

Here are six quick things to know. \nWhat she\u2019s doing now: Jackson currently sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to which she was confirmed last June. She\u2019s also been a federal public defender and is a sentencing expert, having served as vice chair and commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, according to her court-issued biography. \nSecond-youngest justice: If confirmed, the 51-year-old Jackson would be the second-youngest justice on the high court, behind Donald Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett, who is 50.\nShe\u2019s sided with Trump at least once: Jackson sided with the administration of Biden\u2019s Republican predecessor, concluding, as NPR reports, that the Department of Homeland Security could waive more than two dozen environmental laws to build a segment of Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico. \nBut another Jackson ruling was a blow to Trump, as she ruled against his White House\u2019s efforts to block former counsel Don McGahn from testifying in the congressional impeachment probe. \u201cPresidents are not kings,\u201d she wrote. \nRelated to Paul Ryan by marriage: Jackson is related by marriage to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was also a Republican vice-presidential candidate. Her husband\u2019s brother is married to the sister of Ryan\u2019s wife. Ryan said in a statement Friday that he and his wife Janna are \u201cincredibly happy\u201d for Jackson, and praised her character \u2014 in spite of their differing political views. \nShe clerked for the man she would replace: Jackson would replace Justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she was once a law clerk. Breyer reportedly has described her as \u201cgreat, brilliant, decent, with a mix of common sense and thoughtfulness.\u201d\nSharing a scene with Matt Damon: While at Harvard University, Jackson reportedly shared a drama-class scene with future Hollywood star Matt Damon. She didn\u2019t end up pursuing the stage or screen, however, graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in government from Harvard in 1992 and then from Harvard Law School in 1996. "

        "body": " \nI was born out of wedlock in the mid-1960s.\nMy biological father was not listed on my original birth certificate. My birth mother died when I was a tot, and I was then adopted by my maternal grandparents. I didn\u2019t even know the circumstances of my birth until I was a teenager.\nMy biological father abandoned me and my mother. I met him as a young adult and have since lost contact, as he is avoiding me for some reason. Do I have any legal claims to any possible inheritance when he does eventually pass away?\nAbandoned and Adopted Son\n \nDiscovering that you had a father you never knew about must have come as a shock to you, and it must have taken great courage to seek him out. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no accounting for other people\u2019s behavior, including that of one\u2019s parents. As to your question, it\u2019s complicated, and the answer will vary by state. It also depends on the forensic circumstances of your case.\nLeaving aside his potential reasons for not maintaining contact, your father could end up including you in his will. That would obviously be the easiest way to ensure you inherited a share of his estate. The opposite, of course, is also true. He could make efforts to exclude you from his will, if he believed you were interested in an inheritance and preserve the shares of other heirs.\nGenerally \u2014 but not always \u2014 the inheritance rights of a child to claim a share of his or her biological parents\u2019 estate are irrevocably severed when he or she is adopted. That said, the adopted child is entitled to a share of their adoptive parents\u2019 estate equal to those of their siblings, regardless of whether those siblings are adopted or biological children.\u00a0\n \u201cGenerally, the inheritance rights of a child to claim a share of his or her biological parents\u2019 estate is severed when they are adopted.\u201d \nThere was a highly unusual case in New York in 2005, where a woman, Mildred Murphy, specifically bequeathed money and a cottage by a lake to her biological son, Arthur, who was subsequently known as Clair Willard Manning in his adopted family, and cash to his two children. But Arthur/Clair predeceased his biological mother by 11 months.\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that when Mildred named her son in her will, he was\u00a0 no longer a legal stranger. \u201cWe therefore conclude that when Mildred Murphy named her adopted-out son Clair as a beneficiary of her will, she triggered the condition in \u00a7117(2) that made him a non-stranger, and thus her issue, with respect to the relevant bequest,\u201d the ruling said. \nIn California, adoption similarly severs the legal relationship between the biological parent and their child. But there are exceptions \u2014 namely, if the biological parent and adopted child lived together as parent and child, or the biological parent in question was cohabiting or married to the other biological parent at the time the child was conceived, and died before the child\u2019s birth.\n \u201cThe law on the rights of adoptees to inherit from their biological parents\u2019 estate differs from California and New York to Texas.\u201d \nIn Texas, the law is different again, and would appear to be in your favor. \u201cSection 161.2061, an order terminating the parent-child relationship divests the parent and the child of all legal rights and duties with respect to each other, except that the child retains the right to inherit from and through the parent unless the court otherwise provides.\u201d \nAs the Willi Law Firm in Austin, Texas, states: \u201cWhile adoption records are sealed in Texas, if an adopted child is able to determine the identity of his birth parents and the parental rights termination order does not preclude inheritance rights, that child will be in line for inheritance from the birth parents.\u201d This could be done by obtaining an affidavit or certificate of heirship.\nYour father was not aware you were adopted, but he did abandon you and your mother prior to your adoption. Consult an estate lawyer in your state to determine the viability of any claim succeeding. Depending on where you live, your case could set a legal precedent like the estate of Mildred Murphy or, far more likely, you could embark on a costly and, ultimately, futile legal process.\nIf your biological father does not wish to have a relationship with you, that\u2019s a choice you will ultimately have to accept. If he suspects that you want more from the relationship than the opportunity to get to know him, odds are that that would close any remaining doors. I hope your maternal grandparents gave you what you needed to embark on a happy, fulfilling life.\u00a0\nYour emotional and financial independence is a bequest that no amount of money can buy.\u00a0\nYou\u00a0can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com, and follow Quentin Fottrell on\u00a0Twitter.\nCheck out\u00a0the Moneyist private Facebook\u00a0group, where we look for answers to life\u2019s thorniest money issues.

        "body": " \nLast September, my older brother took his own life after living with depression. My brother misused alcohol as well. I moved away in my mid-20s, which allowed me to grow and learn and be an adult. My brother really had no real life skills.\nOver the years he was coddled by our adoptive, loving parents. They did what they thought best, but in the end, it hindered him as he let them take care of him until my mother passed in October 2017, and then my father in December 2020. \nDuring our parents\u2019 later years, they quit traveling to take care of my brother, who would drink alcohol and fall. They were afraid they\u2019d come home and find him dead. So they stopped seeing my family and me as often as they would have liked.\n \nAs my parents grew older, a former girlfriend of my brother visited my parents and helped them with errands. My brother was infatuated with her and obsessed with getting back with her. She would say no, but it was always on his mind.\nAfter my dad passed, a friend called the police to do a welfare check on my brother. He was out cold. The doctor told him that he needed to change his ways or he would be dead in six months. I discovered his female friend bought him vodka.\nAt the end of September, he took his own life. His former girlfriend inherited everything \u2014 a seven-figure estate. She told me that he talked many times about suicide. I would have removed the guns from the house had I known he owned any.\n \nShe also said that he talked to her about stocks, and showed her how to trade. I suspect she knew the value of his estate. In a letter written in May 2021, he said I should get the family home and a portion of his large bank account. \nUnfortunately, my brother didn\u2019t understand that this note wasn\u2019t legal or binding, as there were no witnesses to it. I asked for my father\u2019s portion of the estate, which adds up to $2 million out of almost $6 million. I\u2019m willing to take $1.5 million.\nI suspect there was some other intent here \u2014 that she played the long game. She\u2019s been very hesitant about giving me anything. She said she could honor my parents by not \u201cblowing it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou could honor them by giving me what I ask for.\u201d\nShould I bring this to the attention of the police? They still have his suicide notes \u2014 he left around a dozen around the house. It\u2019s really a \u201che said/she said\u201d situation, and I have no proof that she kept anything from me. Could I possibly sue for negligence?\nA Grieving and Confused Brother\n \nI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry that your brother had such a hard life. I\u2019m sorry that he tried so hard to get sober and fell off the wagon. And I\u2019m sorry that he thought there was no way out and took his life, especially in such a manner. His world got smaller, and he felt his options were limited. He invited this former girlfriend into his life, and she may or may not have provided him with the companionship that he needed and/or enabled his drinking. We will probably never really know.\nFor your brother\u2019s will to be valid, it must be signed by two witnesses in most states and they should not stand to inherit anything from the estate. The law varies from state to state. Generally, a will can be contested on one of three grounds: lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence from a third party, or improper execution. The latter is often the easiest and most common way a will is contested and/or overturned. But you may have grounds on the first two.\n \u201cIt would be near-impossible to draw a straight line through your brother\u2019s fragile mental health, his relationship with alcohol and his former girlfriend\u2019s intentions.\u201d \nContesting the will would likely be expensive and be an ordeal for you and, of course, his former girlfriend. The statute of limitations for contesting a will varies from state to state, so if you wish to take this road, you should talk to your lawyer, and do so without wasting any time. When your lawyer has all the details, he or she will advise you of the likelihood of succeeding in a potential case, and whether it\u2019s worth pursuing.

        "author": "Associated Press",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For months, the White House made highly unusual releases of intelligence findings about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s plans to attack Ukraine. Hoping to pre-empt an invasion, it released details of Russian troop buildups and warned repeatedly that a major assault was imminent.\nIn the end, Putin attacked anyway.\nCritics of U.S. intelligence \u2014 including Russian officials who dismissed invasion allegations as fantasy \u2014 had been pointing to past failures like the false identification of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But Russia\u2019s invasion so far has played out largely as the Biden administration said it would back in December, with nearly 200,000 troops striking from several sides of Ukraine.\nKey Words (October 2021): Colin Powell \u2018scrubbed\u2019 from U.N. testimony in 2003 all but 2% to 5% of flawed intelligence on Iraq\u2019s weapons, longtime ally estimates\nLawmakers from both major U.S. political parties on Thursday said the accurate predictions were a credit to the often-criticized U.S. intelligence community.\nBut whether the White House\u2019s unprecedented public campaign delayed or limited Putin\u2019s plans could be debated for years. And some say both Washington and Kyiv could have done more with the information the two governments had beforehand.\nUkrainians are fighting a vastly more powerful Russian army all over their country, with deaths reported on both sides and explosions in several cities. There are fears Russia may try to depose Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, even as Putin claims \u2014 in the face of the U.S. intelligence \u2014 that Russia is only trying to protect residents of two separatist territories in eastern Ukraine.\nKey Words: Zelensky to EU leaders: \u2018This might be the last time you see me alive\u2019\nAnnouncing new sanctions on Thursday, President Joe Biden cited his administration\u2019s moves to warn of what it knew of Putin\u2019s intentions.\n\u201cWe shared declassified evidence about Russia\u2019s plans and false pretext so that there could be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.\u201d\nSen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, noted several results of the public campaign: weakening any potential move by Putin to create a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation to justify war, undercutting any potential coup in Kyiv that might have appeared to be led by Ukrainians, and unifying allies who quickly denounced Putin\u2019s aggression this week and backed tough sanctions.\n\u201cThe intelligence community usually doesn\u2019t like to share information; they want to hold it close,\u201d Warner said in an interview. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is push the Russian timeline back. They\u2019ve also, I think, allowed us to build this coalition that is virtually unprecedented.\u201d\nSee: Russia mapping out \u2018false flag\u2019 incident in eastern Ukraine as pretext to invade, according to \u2018very credible\u2019 U.S. intelligence assessment\nPlus: Russia has plan for faked video that would give pretext for invasion of Ukraine: reports\nAlso: U.S. intelligence accuses financial site Zero Hedge of disseminating Russian propaganda\nOhio Rep. Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the Biden administration\u2019s declassifying of information was \u201cincredibly important.\u201d\n\u201cThis has both impacted the international community\u2019s view of Putin and has slowed his actions,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThe goal in releasing intelligence is to permit Ukraine to plan, and any delay in Putin\u2019s actions helped Ukraine in the planning to defend itself.\u201d\nBut Turner said the White House should have provided more lethal weapons and air defense capability to Ukraine in advance. He also said that the White House was initially reluctant to provide some of its intelligence findings to Kyiv.\nOne U.S. official familiar with the intelligence gathering, who was not authorized to comment publicly by name, said the White House shared intelligence with Ukraine about Russia even before the troop buildup began last year and accelerated its sharing throughout the crisis. The official added that the administration reduced constraints to allow findings to be shared with the Ukrainians and more broadly with allies.\nStill, Washington and Kyiv were often publicly and privately at odds about the nature of the Russian threat and what needed to be done.\nZelensky for months tried to publicly downplay American warnings of an imminent major outbreak, noting that Ukraine remained locked in an eight-year war over the eastern Donbas region fighting Russian-backed separatists. Zelenskyy did not call up military reservists until Wednesday, when he also announced a 30-day state of emergency.\n\u201cThe one area that I wish we could have been more effective is convincing the Ukrainians themselves to further mobilize their troops, their reserves,\u201d Warner said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that would have stopped the Russian invasion. The Russian forces are so overwhelming. But it might have allowed a bit of a better fight.\u201d\nA Ukrainian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said Kyiv was convinced about two weeks ago that Russia would invade. But the government publicly tamped down concerns about an invasion to limit damage to Ukraine\u2019s economy and panic in the country, the official said. Any mass mobilization of Ukrainian forces could have given additional pretext to Putin, who repeatedly and falsely claimed Ukraine was planning to attack separatist-held parts of the the Donbas.\nThe official also noted that only on Wednesday did the U.S. sanction the company that built the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Zelensky and lawmakers from both parties had long pushed for the sanctions on the pipeline, which would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany and bypass Ukraine.\nSee: Everything you need to know about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline\nAlso: Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspends German certification of Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia\n\u201cWe wish it were a deterrence victory, not an intelligence victory,\u201d the official said. \u201cUnfortunately there was zero deterrence, and now we have a humanitarian catastrophe.\u201d"

        "body": "Investors should probably hold back from putting cash to work in the sinking stock market as geopolitical fears swirl around Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\u201cNow is not a time to be buying the dip if you have cash,\u201d said Christopher, in a phone interview Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cAnd don\u2019t sell.\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a time to be patient\u201d as there\u2019s \u201ctoo much uncertainty.\u201d\nU.S. stocks were falling Thursday afternoon, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.51% showing a sharp decline of 1.5%, according to FactSet data, at last check. The S&P 500 index SPX, +2.24% was down 0.5%, deepening its fall into correction territory.\nWhile investors have been anxious about geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine, a full-scale invasion of the country by Russia was not priced into markets, according to Christopher. The stock market is on its \u201cheels\u201d ahead of anticipated rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, possibly as soon as next month, to tame high inflation that risks running hotter because of the invasion, he said.\u00a0\nWhile some investors may also be worrying about the potential for another \u201cCold War,\u201d he said it\u2019s not clear Russia would have the economic resources to expand its \u201cimperial reach\u201d and subjugate countries in a buffer zone around its borders like in the days of the former Soviet Union.\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday, while announcing new international sanctions against Russia, said it was still too early to tell if the conflict in Ukraine could be contained or if it would spill over into another Cold War. \n\u201cThe more immediate worry for investors is what happens with inflation,\u201d said Christopher, pointing to potential disruptions to the balance of supply and demand in energy, aluminum, nickel and fertilizer. That could push up prices. \u201cWith inflation running at 7.5% year-over-year, that spillover is the main concern for investors.\u201d\nRead: Ukraine invasion stokes stagflation worries because Russia is a \u2018commodity superstore\u2019\nIn Christopher\u2019s view, rate hikes by the Fed aren\u2019t \u201coff the table\u201d despite the turmoil created by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine on Thursday. While \u201ca more moderate Fed going forward seems likely,\u201d Christopher said that with the economy still growing \u201cthey could easily still do a quarter point in March and then just say \u2018we\u2019ll be data dependent\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\nRead: Fed\u2019s Barkin: Will have to wait and see if Russia invasion of Ukraine changes logic for planned rate hikes\nIn the meantime, Christopher said he continues to favor U.S. stocks over international equities, saying Russian-related tensions likely will weigh more heavily on European markets. \nThe STOXX Europe 600 SXXP, +3.32% index closed 3.3% lower Thursday, while London\u2019s FTSE 100 index UKX, +3.91% dropped 3.9%, according to FactSet data.\n\u201cDespite its physical size, Russia has a relatively small economy and its largest trading partners are China and Europe,\u201d according to a Wells Fargo Investment Research note Wednesday that was authored by Christopher. \u201cThere is little direct trade between Russia and the world outside of Europe and China, so both the sanctions on Russia and damage to sentiment likely will fall squarely on the European economies.\u201d\nSee: EU plans \u2018harshest\u2019 sanctions package ever against Russia\nWithin equities, Christopher told MarketWatch he continues to like \u201cquality\u201d bets in areas including information technology and communication services, as well as \u201ccyclicals\u201d such as financials and industrials. He said he recommends underweighting defensive sectors including utilities and consumer staples.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a recession\u201d in 2022, Christopher said. \u201cWe think you\u2019ll have a chance to buy equities later this year.\u201d"

        "body": "Stocks rose this past week despite Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014or perhaps because of it. The risk of an attack hung over markets for weeks, so the actual start of war may have shifted investors\u2019 focus to the chances of a resolution. And some traders are clearly betting that the Federal Reserve will slow its tightening in response, giving riskier assets a chance to rise more.\nThe Nasdaq Composite led the market\u2019s rebound, rising 1.1% on the week, as investors bet that tech stocks would outperform if the Fed is less aggressive. The S&P 500 index rose 0.8% on the week. It\u2019s still down 8% this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell less than 0.1%. \nIt\u2019s an odd moment for a \u201crelief rally,\u201d and it might not last. Russian bombings and troop movements amount to the worst-case scenario rather than the best-case scenario of a limited operation in Eastern Ukraine. \nEnergy is at the crux of this conflict. Oil prices rose sharply when the invasion began, with Brent crude rising as high as $105 a barrel on Thursday morning, the highest level since 2014. European natural-gas prices jumped 60%. But prices of oil and gas eased hours later, as it became clear that most Russian energy wouldn\u2019t face sanctions, so global supply will stay relatively high. Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, called President Joe Biden\u2019s response \u201csoft.\u201d\n\u201cHe totally punted on that one,\u201d he said, noting that energy makes up nearly half of Russia\u2019s exports. \u201cWhere\u2019s the teeth in the sanctions?\u201d\nBrent settled at $97.93 on Friday, up 4.7% on the week. Oil companies with operations in Russia, including BP (ticker: BP), Schlumberger (SLB), and Exxon Mobil (XOM), fell more than competitors when the invasion happened. Some investors say they are looking to U.S. shale names that can benefit from the rise in prices without as many geopolitical risks. Shale producers entered 2022 with fewer price hedges than they have had in years.\n\u201cIt is certainly an environment where we\u2019re looking for opportunities, particularly looking at exploration-and-production companies,\u201d Mike Morey, chief investment officer at Integrity Viking Funds, tells Barron\u2019s. His top holding is Devon Energy (DVN), whose dividend yield could soar to 10% this year, he says.\n\nHe also likes Houston producers Marathon Oil (MRO) and Coterra Energy (CTRA), which mostly produces natural gas. If Coterra keeps paying dividends at the same rate it did last quarter, its dividend yield will be over 10%.\nDavid Heikkinen, a managing director at the Houston-based asset manager Pickering Energy Partners, likes APA (APA), the parent of oil producer Apache. APA has a diverse resource base, with operations in Europe\u2019s North Sea and Egypt, as well as in the U.S. Heikkinen cites APA\u2019s exposure to Brent crude, which is trading much higher than West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, because of the risk premium from the Russian invasion. \nHe also thinks that APA could see a larger benefit from oil price gains because its balance sheet is more leveraged than some rivals\u2019, and the stock has been a laggard of late. It trades at just 5.3 times its expected earnings over the next year, versus 10.5 times for EOG Resources (EOG) and 10.3 times for Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). \u201cIt\u2019s a really cheap stock,\u201d he says.\nInvestors have avoided energy stocks for years, but an imbalance between supply and demand has become increasingly lucrative for producers. That had escaped many investors\u2019 attention, but with the Ukraine shock, Heikkinen notes, \u201cyou\u2019ve now got that trigger.\u201d\nPlenty of industrial stocks offered investors good value and potential gains entering 2022. The Ukraine conflict doesn\u2019t change that, but it will make investors re-evaluate some sectors. \nFor example, higher oil prices will lead investors to look harder at companies that sell into energy end markets. \nPump and valve maker Flowserve (FLS) is on a \u201cshortlist of industrial stocks with leverage to [oil and gas] commodities,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst John Walsh recently wrote. Roughly a third of Flowserve sales come from the oil-and-gas sector. \nThe shares dropped 6% this past week because of continued supply-chain challenges related to Covid. Walsh sees those problems reversing as Covid-related constraints ease. Walsh\u2019s price target is $38 a share, almost 30% above recent levels. \nIndustrial stocks were beating the market before Ukraine. There\u2019s no reason for that to change. \n\u2014Al Root\n \nWrite to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com"

Each benefits from scarcity. If governments depreciate their currencies by running up debts and printing money, the story goes, Bitcoin could serve as a bulwark against inflation and loss of purchasing power\u2014even taking some of gold\u2019s market share. \nYet Bitcoin\u2019s high volatility and ailing price make it increasingly hard to accept it as more than a speculative bet.

        "body": "As the world focuses on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s incursion into Ukraine, investors may be missing the forest for the trees.\nThe move by the second-largest oil exporter into its neighbor on Wednesday night quickly went from a foray into Ukraine\u2019s eastern tip to airstrikes across dozens of Ukrainian cities. Strategists, including some Putin watchers who believed that the Kremlin was ultimately bluffing and would stick within the Donbas region, say they are girding for prolonged turmoil, increased market volatility, and intensified economic ramifications. \nBut the biggest implication for the U.S. of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict may not actually be what happens in the region. Rather, it is likely to be whether the U.S.\u2019s response to the conflict emboldens bigger economic rivals, namely China, and what that means for the long-term investment landscape.\nThis is not to say there aren\u2019t important economic and political consequences of Putin\u2019s land grab and self-described effort to demilitarize the former Soviet Republic. There are many. Most obviously, there is the impact on energy prices. Oil leapt 8% on Thursday, with the prices of Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude topping $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Other commodities are similarly surging. Analysts call Russia and Ukraine breadbaskets, as together they represent more than a quarter of the global wheat export market and a significant slice of the world\u2019s corn market. Consumers, already miserable and expressing the lowest degree of economic confidence in a decade, will pay more at the pump and beyond as sanctions, supply shortages, and traders rushing to buy up commodities hit prices. \nMoreover, Russia is in a position where it could threaten to selfembargo commodity exports, says Marko Papic, chief strategist at Clocktower Group. He notes that the country\u2019s current account, as a share of its gross domestic product, is the biggest since 2006, while its foreign-exchange reserves are at the highest level since 2014, meaning Russia could leverage both to impose export embargoes for up to six months.\nThe latest commodity price spikes come at a particularly fraught time for the global economy. U.S. gasoline prices rose 40% in January from a year earlier alongside double-digit price increases for basic food items such as flour and meat. In Europe, where Russia is the biggest supplier of natural gas, Germany is on the brink of recession. That country\u2014Europe\u2019s largest economy\u2014recently reported a record 25% year-over-year jump in producer prices, thanks to a 67% increase in energy costs. Nancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, says the euro zone was already destined to slow sharply. The conflict will deepen and extend that slowdown, she says, possibly tipping the bloc into recession next year.\nAs for the U.S., economists at Goldman Sachs say every $10-a-barrel rise in the price of oil boosts headline inflation by about 0.2 percentage point and core inflation by about 0.04 percentage point. Based on predictions across Wall Street for $120 oil and some back-of-the-envelope math, that roughly means the U.S. consumer price index goes to an annual pace of 8.1% from 7.5% in January including energy, and to 6.1% from 6% excluding energy. \nAs Papic puts it, the conflict in Ukraine is the cherry on top of an inflationary sundae. That may prove increasingly true if heightened geopolitical uncertainty translates to a less aggressive Federal Reserve\u2014even if the one thing that is certain is more inflation. Oren Klachkin, an economist at Oxford Economics, says the conflict in Ukraine will shave up to 0.2 percentage point off real, or inflation-adjusted, 2022 GDP. Hardly anything, that is, in part due to the expectation that higher oil prices will drive stronger growth in domestic oil, gas, and agriculture sectors to offset the impact on real household incomes. \nDespite Wall Street\u2019s expectations for a minimal hit to growth from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, traders have quickly pared interest-rate hike expectations that had ratcheted higher after the January CPI, and all but scrapped odds of a half-point hike when the Fed meets March 15-16. \n\u201cThe chance of the Fed raising by two percentage points over the next year is approximately zero,\u201d says Michael Ashton, founder and investment manager at Enduring Investments, referring to recent projections by J.P. Morgan and others for a policy rate of at least 2% by the end of 2022. \u201cThis is a great excuse for them to wait and see,\u201d he says of policy makers, increasingly suspecting that the Fed will point to geopolitical uncertainty in deferring any more than 0.75 percentage point in rate increases this year.\nFor all of the potential implications of the crisis in Ukraine for the U.S. economy, financial markets, and the path of monetary policy, concerns over them may mask something more consequential. How the U.S. responds to Putin\u2019s play in Ukraine may affect how Chinese President Xi Jinping does or doesn\u2019t proceed with reclaiming Taiwan, which is much more critical to the global supply chain and thus the U.S. economy and financial markets. Taiwan\u2019s domination of semiconductor manufacturing is particularly notable at a time when the global chip shortage is one factor behind the everything shortage. \n\u201cThe importance of what happens in Ukraine is how we respond, because that will affect what happens in Taiwan,\u201d says Ashton. \u201cIf you persuade geopolitical rivals that we are weak in the knees, that\u2019s where it can get really tense.\u201d \nIf the recovery in stocks on Thursday was in part spurred by President Joe Biden\u2019s new round of economic sanctions against Russia, then one interpretation is that the punishment is relatively light. Specifically, the Biden administration left out punishing sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector, with Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh saying the latest sanctions aren\u2019t designed to disrupt the flow of energy to the world. \nThat isn\u2019t to say that the sanctions announced by Biden and some European countries won\u2019t be painful for Russia, and it isn\u2019t to suggest the U.S. should seek punishments that boomerang\u2014especially at a time when high energy and food prices are already hurting plenty of American households and businesses. Nor is it to say that the administration won\u2019t eventually go there. For now, Biden isn\u2019t alone. Reflecting how precarious the situation is for Europe and how acute the inflation threat is to political leaders, Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Mario Draghi has said that any sanctions the European Union imposes on Russia shouldn\u2019t include energy. \nBut a response to Russia by the U.S. that is perceived as weak makes it all the more important for investors to consider a potential Chinese play for Taiwan. A tepid response could offer a green light for China to proceed with an incursion into Taiwan, says Klachkin of Oxford Economics, adding that there is an ongoing, coordinated effort by China and Russia to grab power from the West and that it probably isn\u2019t a coincidence that Russia waited until after the Olympics in Beijing before invading Ukraine.\nFor his part, Ashton of Enduring Investments pegs the likelihood of China moving on Taiwan at not quite 50/50. But, he says, odds are up from effectively zero a few years ago and are high enough that investors should take the scenario seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a better time to try for it, if China really does want Taiwan back,\u201d given how the pandemic has hobbled the world, inflation is rattling economies and politicians, and much of the world\u2019s attention is currently on Russia and Ukraine. He adds that markets would be a lot lower if they were appreciating Taiwan risk.\nAs for potential timing, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Clocktower\u2019s Papic calls China\u2019s intervention in Taiwan the greatest geopolitical risk for investors, but he says that Xi has no reason to rush. \u201cOne benefit for China of the ongoing conflict between the West and Russia is that it can observe from a distance what the U.S. reaction is to Russian aggression,\u201d he says.\nRegardless of whether Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine portends a similar move by Xi in Taiwan, strategists say that investors should anticipate an extended stretch of increased geopolitical turmoil. The bigger point, says Papic, who stresses the need for investors to be political nihilists when analyzing geopolitics, is that the U.S. seems to have realized it is no longer the global hegemon. \u201cNo other power gives two hoots what Washington wants,\u201d he says, something he observes has been true for several administrations and is characteristic of a multipolar, versus unipolar, world. \nThe upshot? Papic says the coming decade should be a bumper harvest of geopolitical alpha. For now, he favors wheat, gold, oil, and palladium as hedges against further conflict.\nProlonged global upheaval augurs prolonged inflation, exacerbated by efforts already under way by U.S. manufacturers to bring supply chains closer to home. The trade-offs facing the Fed\u2014more inflation for a less-severe hit to growth, and vice versa\u2014are only getting harsher with the likelihood of both climbing.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@barrons.com"

        "body": "I asked two market strategists whether U.S. investors should buy stocks here despite the pall of war in Ukraine. One says definitely, and the other says to hold off. Both are convincing. This is why I recommend using an odd number of investment advisors. \nIf there\u2019s a cheerful sign now, it\u2019s that investors are gloomy, says Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, which sells market analysis to money managers. A measure called the Investors Intelligence bulls and bears ratio fell this past week, to 1.04, from 1.32 two weeks prior. That means there are roughly as many bears as bulls, which is unusual, and which Yardeni has found to signal a good buying opportunity. \nThe problem is that if war drags on and oil prices spike, it could add to inflation, force the Federal Reserve to stick to plans to aggressively raise interest rates, and perhaps even trigger a recession. \n\u201cI think we are in the hands, right now, of Vladimir Putin,\u201d Yardeni says.\nPutin-hands sounds bearish, and maybe a little moleish, but recession is by no means assured. Texas crude oil did shoot above $100 a barrel on Thursday after the start of the invasion, but it ended the day at $93. \nEconomists for now predict a sharp slowdown in economic growth, but not a contraction. \nLast year, gross domestic product surged 6.9%, the fastest since 1984, helped by inventory rebuilding. \nFor the current quarter, the GDPNow predictor tracked by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pegs growth at just 0.6% annualized. Goldman Sachs last month slashed its first-quarter forecast to 0.5% from 2%. \nYardeni says that it\u2019s too late for investors to panic and sell stocks, and that long-term holders can find good deals now. But he is watching for further growth deterioration, from oil, interest rate increases\u2014or both. \u201cThis geopolitical crisis will at some point pass, but it\u2019s not necessarily a short-term buying opportunity,\u201d he says. \nDecidedly more bullish is Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, a large broker-dealer serving nearly 20,000 financial advisors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of got the markings of a potential washout,\u201d he said of the trading this past Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite on that day briefly fell more than 3% before closing more than 3% higher\u2014something it hadn\u2019t done since 2008. \nDetrick has made a study of U.S. stock declines and rebounds following invasions, assassinations, embargoes, terrorist attacks, and other mayhem, and drawn some conclusions that bode well now. The fallout for markets tends to be short-lived. It took U.S. stocks 31 days to get back to even following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, and 65 days after the 1968 Tet Offensive, a major escalation during the Vietnam War. The longest setbacks for stocks on Detrick\u2019s list were 189 days following Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and 307 days after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. \nFor returns following geopolitical shocks, there has been a clear divide between those that triggered recessions, which led the S&P 500 an average of more than 11% lower over the following year, and those that didn\u2019t, which gave way to average gains of 11%. Looking strictly at market corrections since 1980 of 10% to 15%, the same range as the recent one, returns from the low point have averaged 22% during the following year. Of course, the difficulty is telling when the low point has been reached. \nThere\u2019s a reason economics is listed as a social science in college course books. It\u2019s to distinguish it from actual science\u2014like physics, where outcomes are often knowable. \nIn economics, scientific methods lead at best to informed guesses about future human behavior. The sample size of past results is always too small, because the number of times conditions have precisely matched now is always zero. In other words, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, as mutual funds must say. \nBut the record at least suggests that investors should stick with stocks, and perhaps add to them. Detrick expects growth to surprise to the upside this year, as the pandemic lifts. \nDetrick likes industrials, financials, and materials companies, and although he has a neutral weighting on technology, he says the sector has fallen far enough to hold some bargains. \nI recently scanned through companies of all sizes in the S&P 1500 index for ones that are 30% to 50% off their highs, and have come down from elevated price/earnings ratios to ordinary ones, or from ordinary ones to depressed ones.\nThe list included Stanley Black & Decker (ticker: SWK), the tool maker, now selling for less than 13 times earnings, versus 18 times a year ago. Apparel maker V.F. Corp. (VFC), whose brands include Vans, the North Face, and Dickies, recently changed hands at 16 times earnings, down from 28 times.\n FedEx (FDX) has been abandoned by investors amid Amazon.com\u2019s rise in shipping, but it\u2019s still growing, and generating $3 billion to $4 billion a year in free cash against a stock market value of $57 billion. Qorvo (QRVO), a maker of smartphone chips, has taken a beating after its past two earnings reports, and now goes for less than 11 times earnings, down from 16 times a year ago. \nBut investors might prefer to pay up instead for Qualcomm (QCOM), at 14 times earnings, which is down less from its high and seems to be gaining market share. \nThen there are impressive companies that have gotten cheaper, but still cost plenty. \n Trex (TREX) is down from 50 times earnings to 34 times. It turns scrap wood and plastic into weather-resistant boards for decks. \n Five Below (FIVE), meanwhile, is at 28 times earnings, down from 49. It sells cheap, but lucrative, trinkets for tweens. Both companies are seen growing earnings at rates near 20% for years. \nFortunately, better stock pickers than I have ideas elsewhere in this magazine.\nWrite to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com.

Here are 3 reasons for the rebound.\nMarket bottoms more typically are made when despondent investors throw in the towel. Yet the narrative being used to support the \u201cbottom is in\u201d belief in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that stocks spring back quickly from geopolitical crises. As MarketWatch reported earlier this week: \u201cDespite near-term volatility in the wake of geopolitical events over the past three decades, ranging from terrorist attacks to the start of wars, stocks have tended to bounce back relatively quickly, \u2026 rallying 4.6% on average in the six months following such crises dating back to 1990 and rising 81% of the time.\u201d\nOr consider this tweet a money manager sent out after the news broke that Russia had invaded Ukraine: \u201cExcellent buying opportunities never feel good at the time.\u201d After presenting one of the many lists of past geopolitical events that are circulating around Wall Street, the tweet continued: \u201cLesson? Buy when there\u2019s blood in the streets.\u201d\n \u201c Like telling a boxer to celebrate being knocked down because it creates the opportunity to get up again. \u201d \nThese narratives gloss over the extent of the short-term losses that geopolitical events inflict on investors. The attitude adopted by the market\u2019s cheerleaders is like telling a boxer to celebrate being knocked down because it creates the opportunity to get up again.\nAnother problem with these rosy pictures is that they subjectively use past geopolitical crises to prove their point. A far different conclusion emerges if we focus on a specific subset of global crises relative to this latest one: war. \nThe chart below highlights six major geopolitical events since 1941 that involved military invasions and/or threats to national sovereignty. The chart plots the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +2.24% performance over the six months following the conclusion of those crises. In three of these six instances, U.S. stocks had yet to recover.\nNotice too that it can take weeks or months following a crisis before the market hits bottom. The average across all six of the crises in the chart is 60 trading days \u2014 about three months. In no past crisis did the market bottom on the day of the invasion or attack.\nAnalysts are not wrong to point out that the market often registers a bottom several weeks after a geopolitical crisis. But it\u2019s a matter of emphasis. It\u2019s one thing to remind investors of this history when they expect that the worst is still ahead. It\u2019s quite another to do so when investors believe that new bull-market highs will come later this year.\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

Morgan\u2019s Philip Cusick bumped up his rating on Dish\u2019s stock DISH, +11.34% by two notches, to overweight from underweight, writing that while the company still faces some challenges, Dish\u2019s vast spectrum holdings create a floor under the stock. \n\u201cWith shares substantially lower, from here we see a better value proposition as well as positive upcoming data points improving sentiment on Dish shares, which seem oversold vs. the underlying value of spectrum, though we acknowledge potential execution challenges, including risk of further delay of the Las Vegas commercial launch, business model questions, and funding risks,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients Friday morning. \nDish shares rose 11.3% in Friday\u2019s session, delivering their largest single-day percentage gain since March 24, 2020, when they rose 14.3%. The jump built on a 6.9% rally in Thursday\u2019s session following the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report.\nSee more: Dish Network profit matches consensus for Q4 while revenue falls slightly short\nThe company has committed to deploying 5G that can serve 20% of the U.S. population by June 2022, Dish noted in its 10-K filing.

        "body": "After two years of disrupted travel plans amid the coronavirus pandemic, the fading of the Omicron variant has many older Americans eager to return to the roads and skies in coming months. There\u2019s no guarantee, however, that another variant won\u2019t upend plans or lead vulnerable people to rethink their travels.\u00a0\nThe good news is the travel industry is much more flexible with vacationers who need to change plans. Many car rental shops and hotels allow cancellations within 24 hours of pickup or arrival. And most airlines aren\u2019t charging fees for changes up to 24 hours before a flight; some allow same-day changes fee-free. Even cruise lines, which have a reputation for being inflexible, have relaxed their change policies.\nThe bad news is that stuff still happens to mess up vacations. So for those hoping to travel over the next few months, it pays to learn details on cancellations, itinerary changes, and protecting your budget.\nKnow the Rules\nBefore booking any trips, plan for potential disruptions, says Jeanenne Tornatore, a travel expert at the Outside Insider. Travelers should read the cancellation policies for airlines, hotels and activities that require prebooking so they know their options. Don\u2019t just rely on websites, especially for small businesses.\u00a0\nCheck the cancellation policies for specific hotels since the individual locations of name-brand hotels such as Marriott or Hilton could be franchises, says Cameron Sperance, hospitality reporter for Skift, a travel news site. Hotels need to comply with certain corporate standards to carry the brand\u2019s name, such as health and safety measures, but the individual properties have some flexibility when it comes to bookings.\u00a0\nWhile hotels may offer vacationers leeway when it comes to cancellations, it\u2019s a different story for lodgings booked through sites like AirBnB and VRBO. Those individual owners set the stipulations. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the goodness of their heart whether you\u2019re going to get the full refund,\u201d Sperance says.\nAn important point for budget-conscious travelers: Hotels and airlines may be less generous with refunds for those who opt for rock-bottom rates, especially if travelers cancel close to the booking date, Tornatore adds.\nEven without a surge in Covid variants, staffing shortages in many industries aren\u2019t going away, so book in advance any special excursions, restaurants, spa services, live entertainment or other activities and call ahead to make sure nothing has changed. If live shows get canceled, attendees usually can get refunds; however, if the ticker buyer can\u2019t make it for whatever reason, the venue is unlikely to offer a refund.\u00a0\nOne exception to strict cancellation policies may be showing a positive Covid test close to the travel date, she says, speaking from experience. When a family member tested positive for Covid, she presented the airline with dated copies of positive test results and her family received refunds for their nonrefundable fares.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re able to provide the right information, I think that travel suppliers are still being very flexible. They don\u2019t want people to get on their planes who are positive,\u201d she says.\nCruise Considerations\nCruise lines are giving travelers greater leeway to reschedule or cancel, says Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief at Cruise Critic. Many are allowing cancellations close to the time of departure, some up to 48 hours before ships sail, which was unheard-of prepandemic. Not every cruise line will allow vacationers to cancel for a full refund, but most will offer a future cruise credit. \nCruise-goers should also know the ship\u2019s health and safety protocols. Most boats have capacity limits, and cruise lines may not be sailing all ships. Be prepared to show vaccination and perhaps booster status, as virtually all cruise lines require proof of vaccination, McDaniel says. PCR Covid tests are also required by federal health authorities within two days of boarding. \nCruisers hoping for vaccination waivers based on medical status will need to speak to the cruise line. Some operators are standing firm on a no vaccination, no sailing rule, McDaniel says, such as Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, including for families who haven\u2019t vaccinated young children.\u00a0\nPassengers who test positive for Covid while on board are isolated in a cabin and given room service and in-room entertainment. Travelers who were in close proximity to that person for an extended period of time will be isolated for 24 hours and tested several times to ensure they are negative before they are allowed to leave the cabin, she says.\nWhat\u2019s more, ports determine who is allowed to disembark, and local authorities can change entry requirements at any time. Destinations may require new tests to enter or can refuse entry if even one person on a ship tests positive for Covid. McDaniel says passengers need to consider these potential outcomes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have the best experience if you are flexible and understand that the cruise you book might not be exactly the cruise you take,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0\nIs Travel Insurance Worth It?\nExperts generally say travel protection is worth the cost, but they advise consumers to shop around and read the fine print. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t view it as kind of the ripoff that people may have thought it was prior to the pandemic,\u201d Sperance says.\nThere are two types of primary travel insurance: trip cancellation and travel medical insurance. Trip cancellation policies cover the nonrefundable costs of a trip, such as deposits, lost baggage, trip delays or interruption, and may cover liability for rental cars. Travel medical policies are geared to international travel since in most cases Medicare won\u2019t cover vacationers outside the U.S. and private coverage varies.\u00a0\nFor trip interruption and delays coverage, Sperance says, people should find out if the policy covers extra hotel nights in case a flight is canceled or travelers need to stay in quarantine.\nWith travel medical insurance, he says, look for language that includes coverage for pre-existing conditions and medical evacuation in case of emergencies. Some policies include specifics around Covid, including coverage for quarantine expenses or other medical expenses related to Covid.\u00a0\nThe cost of travel insurance depends on several factors, including destination, and a person\u2019s age and health if they are getting medical coverage, says Rajeev Shrivastava, CEO of travel insurance marketplace VisitorsCoverage.com. For a basic, domestic trip cancellation policy the premium is about 10% of the trip cost.\u00a0\nDepending on the trip, both types of policies can be combined, says Shrivastava.\u00a0\nTornatone, meanwhile, warns travelers to read the policies as certain basic domestic travel insurance may not cover Covid-related travel disruptions. Travelers who want to be covered for anything can get \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d travel policies. However, those may cost 40% to 50% more than basic policies.\u00a0\nBottom Line\nContingency plans are an important part of travel now. If possible, build in extra time on the front and back end of the trip to allow for unexpected delays.\u00a0\nDespite the unknowns, 2022 might be a good time to hit the road, says Laura Breen, director of sales at VBT Bicycling Vacations & Country Walkers, an international tour operator whose demographic skews toward retirees. \u201cIt can be really rewarding to travel right now because places are slightly less crowded than you\u2019re used to,\u201d Breen says.\nWrite to retirement@barrons.com\n "

        "body": "The U.S. stock market entered correction territory this past week. Growth stocks did worse, touching bear market territory. Investors worried about inflation and rising interest rates. Now war threatens to disrupt Europe. \nThe knee-jerk reaction might be to give up, sell stocks, and ride out the volatility, but that could mean missing out on bargains in quality stocks.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see people do is sell after we\u2019ve had such a share drawdown, after we have finally entered a correction,\u201d says SoFi Technologies head of investing strategy Liz Young. Investors can research some new ideas that can weather the current environment, looking for good deals amid market turmoil. \nRBC multi-industry analyst Deane Dray says that investors should focus on high-quality stocks. That means companies with strong management teams, profit margins, and cash flow. \nEarnings matter, too. \u201cYou want a company with a strong E in its P/E ratio,\u201d says Young. Steadily growing earnings offset any compression in price/earnings ratios brought on by either inflation or geopolitical conflict.\nInvestors can also search for companies with more U.S. exposure as tensions rise in Europe. That can help account for the possibility that things take longer than hoped for to resolve across the Atlantic.\n\u201cGeopolitical volatility [is] an opportunity to gain exposure to longer-term positive trends,\u201d says Baird machinery analyst Mig Dobre. \u201c Deere is a great example.\u201d Deere shares (ticker: DE) are down about 15% since mid-February, possibly because roughly 6% of the company\u2019s sales come from Russia. \nCompanies that can grow in all types of conditions have an advantage. CarMax (KMX) aims to sell two million cars a year in five years, up from roughly 1.2 million units in fiscal-year 2021. The company\u2019s volume goal is one of the reasons that Baird analyst Craig Kennison put CarMax stock on his list of best ideas for 2022. \nE=estimate.\nSource: FactSet\nEvoqua Water Technologies(AQUA) provides water and wastewater treatment for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. About 80% of sales are generated in the U.S., and the company is less reliant than other firms on capital spending, notes RBC multi-industry analyst Deane Dray. That means if corporate budgets tighten as the global economy gets more uncertain, Pittsburgh-based Evoqua is less at risk. And everyone in the U.S. will still need water, no matter what happens overseas. Dray\u2019s price target is $50, about 50 times estimated calendar-year 2022 earnings. That\u2019s not cheap, but investors get stability and growth. Earnings are expected to double over the next three years\nE=estimate.\nSource: FactSet\nThe Moline, Ill., farm- and construction-equipment maker generates about 70% of its sales in North and South America. When commodity prices rise, due to weather\u2014or a war in Europe\u2014U.S. farmers can benefit. Russia remains a risk, but the combination of higher commodity prices, rising farm-equipment age, and the trend toward precision-farming technology can overwhelm any temporary hiccup. Mig Dobre, the Baird machinery analyst, has a price target of $487 for Deere (DE), up more than 40% from recent levels. That works out to about 21 times Wall Street\u2019s estimated calendar-year 2022 earnings of $23.19. Those earnings are expected to increase almost 20% from 2021 earnings of $19.61 a share. \nE=estimate.\nSource: FactSet\n\u201cAnytime water utilities do poorly, or just have a period of poor performance, we start going to work,\u201d says Jay Rhame, CEO and portfolio manager at Reaves Asset Management, a firm dedicated to investing in infrastructure and utility stocks. \u201cThey are so reliable, so consistent\u2014getting a cheaper valuation doesn\u2019t come often.\u201d \nAmerican Water Works (AWK) shares dropped more than 20% to start 2022, and now trade for about 33 times estimated 2022 earnings. That might look pricey, but earnings have grown like clockwork for years and are expected to advance at 8% or 9% a year for the foreseeable future. The company has boosted its dividend at about 10% a year on average for a decade. \nE=estimate.\nSource: FactSet\nAtlanta-based Southern Co. (SO) has defensive, high-quality characteristics. Its dividend has grown at about 3% a year on average for the past decade, and shares now yield 4.3%. The shares of the multistate electric-and-gas utility trade for about 17 times estimated 2022 earnings of $3.55 a share. Rhame, of Reaves Asset Management, points out that in 2008, when the market dropped about 38%, Southern stock held its own. The stock is down almost 10% this year, partly because the company pushed back the timeline to start up new nuclear-power generating facilities in Georgia by three to six months. Two new reactors are now slated to be up and running by the end of 2023. \n \nE=Estimate.\nSource: FactSet\nBenchmark analyst Mike Ward says car dealerships are good businesses. \u201cCosts are variable, inventory is largely financed by vehicle manufacturers, and parts-and-service revenue offsets about 75% of fixed costs,\u201d he says. Shares of Richmond, Va.\u2013based CarMax (KMX), the largest used-car dealer in the nation, are down about 20% this year, trading for roughly 14 times estimated calendar-year 2022 earnings. Used-car prices are at record levels, a function of low inventories and low new-car production. Falling used-car prices are a risk, but Craig Kennison, the Baird analyst, says investors should focus on dealerships that can increase volumes so that earnings can grow, even if car prices dip. \nE=estimate.\nSource: FactSet\nBefore Covid, Constellation Brands (STZ) was one of the fastest-growing large-capitalization beverage stocks, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira. Coming out of Covid, volume growth is accelerating as the U.S. wine and beer distributor continues to invest in its brands, such as Corona beer. Shares are down about 15% this year. Investors are worried that profit margins will take a hit as the company ramps up new capacity. But Teixeira notes that new capacity will result in higher volume and improving profit margins. Shares trade for about 19 times estimated calendar-year 2022 earnings per share of about $11.34. Earnings growth is expected to be about 13% a year on average for the next few years. \nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com"

        "body": "As Russian forces were pouring over the border into Ukraine, the tech sector briefly tumbled into a bear market on Thursday. Both the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite fell enough that morning to extend their cumulative declines from their November peaks to more than 20%. It was the first drop of that magnitude since March 2020, at the start of the pandemic. \nLater that day, the stock market staged an impressive turnaround. But I doubt that we\u2019ve seen the last of the bear.\nIn 2020, the sharp, short bear market turned out to be a spectacular buying opportunity, as the Federal Reserve and other central banks flooded the market with cash and interest rates dropped effectively to zero. The result sent high-growth tech stocks to dizzying heights.\nThat was then; this is now. The Fed is getting ready to shut the money spigot, telegraphing multiple rate increases in 2022. The concern is that we\u2019re overheating. But it isn\u2019t hard to see why the bears lost their grip on Thursday, and cash flooded in.\nFor one thing, that 20% tech bear market actually understates the damage. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ticker: ARKK) is a fine proxy for what has befallen high-growth tech. By early Thursday, the fund sat 45% below its November highs. That\u2019s an astonishing collapse: In the 1987 stock market crash, the peak-to-trough decline in the Dow industrials was 36%. \nOf U.S. listed stocks with a market cap above $5 billion, 75 are down 40%-plus since the market peak, including some of the pandemic period\u2019s biggest winners. Roblox (RBLX), the online-gaming platform, has plunged 63% since the market peak, despite an early lead in the emerging metaverse trend. Shopify (SHOP), the e-commerce software provider, is down 60% since the peak, amid concerns about growth as more shoppers return to physical stores. \nWhile the market\u2019s wild swings might seem confusing, they make more sense than you think. Here are a few critical things to consider:\nThat sounds coldhearted, given the death and destruction at the hands of Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops. But Dan Niles, founder of the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund, points out that if you look back at the market\u2019s behavior in 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea, or 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, you will find that the market ignored both events. And he doesn\u2019t think that the current conflict is going to be any different. Neither economy is big enough to affect the average company\u2019s outlook.\nOne trader sees logic in the invasion-day rally in software, in particular. \u201cInstitutional investors are focused on software names, given growth, quality, valuation compression, and a lack of risk from commodity costs,\u201d he told me via email. \u201cIs an invasion of Ukraine, and sanctions on Russia, going to stop companies from digitizing their businesses? And it will definitely force them to spend more to prevent cyberattacks.\u201d\nRussia and Ukraine supply gases and other materials used in semiconductor production. Ukraine supplies most of the world\u2019s neon used in chip-making, for instance. But Citigroup analyst Atif Malik doesn\u2019t expect any major disruption in the semiconductor supply chain. My checks with Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU), and GlobalFoundries (GFS) find that they have all made progress on both the stockpiling of, and finding alternative sources for, major commodities. Russia, meanwhile, accounts for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases, notes the Semiconductor Industry Association. Do you own a Russian PC, smartphone, TV, or electric vehicle? I didn\u2019t think so.\nNo surprise to see security-software stocks on the rise. On Thursday, both Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) jumped more than 14%. Needham analyst Alex Henderson points out in a research note that there is little evidence of cyberattacks on the U.S. or Europe so far, but the Russians have been making threats. What\u2019s clear, Henderson adds, is that we\u2019re \u201centering a new, much more hostile world, and that companies and governments alike face new threats and heightened risks.\u201d\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out before, about 70% of the world\u2019s chips are produced in Taiwan. Recently, there have been reports of increased incursions by Chinese warplanes in Taiwanese airspace. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing shares (TSM) slid this past week on worries that the world\u2019s largest contract chip maker could be disrupted by any move by China to take control of the island while we are distracted by Ukraine. Those same worries spurred gains in other stocks with chip capacity, including Intel and GlobalFoundries.\nSatori Fund\u2019s Niles points out that during the recession of 2007-09, there were 11 rallies of 10% or more\u2014and 12 declines of at least 15% each. Niles has been trading the rally; he bought one U.S.-listed Russian name at the open on Thursday and sold it at the close for a 10% gain. But he adds that \u201cthis is not anywhere near over.\u201d At some point, the market will refocus on rising interest rates. His advice? Pile up cash. \nWrite to Eric J.

        "body": "One of the lofty goals of the Biden administration has been to reduce economic inequality. By one criterion, it seems to be succeeding. \n\u201cMarkets are down, and gas prices are up,\u201d a reporter said to President Joe Biden at his briefing on Thursday announcing further sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?\u201d\nIn his prepared remarks, the president said he would do \u201ceverything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.\u201d \nAs for the financial markets, which were in free fall globally earlier in the day, Biden said that when a nuclear power attacks and invades another country, the world must respond and, in turn, markets will, too. But, he added, \u201cthe notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we\u2019re going to impose on Russia, period.\u201d \nEven before Biden spoke on Thursday afternoon, U.S. stocks had begun to dig themselves out of the hole into which global markets had plunged beginning in the wee hours after Russia began its long-predicted invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq 100 index of the exchange\u2019s biggest nonfinancial stocks, notably the megacap tech names tracked by the popular Invesco QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund (ticker: QQQ), also entered a bear market, with a 20% decline from its highs. At the same time, prices of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, topped $100 a barrel, a level briefly hit by its U.S. counterpart, West Texas Intermediate. In other words, pain was relatively equally distributed on Main Street and Wall Street.\nThe reversals picked up steam after Biden\u2019s news conference. But the U.S. stock market\u2019s turnaround owed more to what Biden didn\u2019t say than what he said. Conspicuously absent among the sanctions that he announced were curbs on Russia\u2019s biggest exports, oil and gas. Instead, the sanctions are focused on its big banks, freezing Russian assets in the U.S., and curbing exports of military items and sensitive technology for Russian defense. He also didn\u2019t cut off Russia from the Swift system for messaging, a crucial part of global financial networks. These measures followed previously announced curbs on Russian debt and equity transactions aimed at limiting Moscow\u2019s ability to raise money on international markets. \nThe equity market\u2019s Thursday turnaround, which transformed a 3.3% opening loss in the Nasdaq 100 into a 3.4% gain by the close, was accompanied by similarly dramatic rebounds in the other major indexes. That also followed sizable reversals in the surge in oil, with U.S. crude settling back at $93, for a rise of less than a buck a barrel. So, score one each for Wall and Main Streets. \nThe dramatic recovery in stocks on Thursday seemed to bear out the advice of those citing the clich\u00e9 to \u201cbuy at the sound of cannons.\u201d \nAny number of historical precedents were assembled by analysts, showing that the beginning of hostilities provides buying opportunities for gains a year later. But most also didn\u2019t take into account other, more mundane factors, notably the impact of monetary policy.\nPerhaps the best comparison to last week\u2019s move by Vlad the Invader might be the first Gulf War, after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, according to John Higgins, writing in Capital Economics\u2019 daily missive. Major stock indexes dropped 20% to 25% but stabilized when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates; shares recovered after the quick victory in Operation Desert Storm. \nThe situation now is markedly different, however. Faced with four-decade-high inflation, the central bank is all but certain to commence normalization of its ultraeasy policy with a liftoff in its federal-funds target from the current 0%-to-0.25% range. \n \nUntil this past week, the question had been whether the increase would be one-quarter or one-half percentage point. The probability of a bigger boost has faded markedly, with the federal-funds futures market putting a 79% probability on a quarter-point move as of late Thursday, a reversal from early February, when the chances of a half-point hike peaked above 80%. \nVarious Fed speakers were noncommittal this past week about the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s potential effect at the much-anticipated March 15-16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cI just think time will tell,\u201d Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin was quoted by Bloomberg as saying.\nBonds & Rates\nThe surge in energy prices, which was well under way before the hostilities began, makes for a conundrum for the Fed. Higher costs at the gasoline pump are a component of inflation, which the central bank and all of Washington agree is the economy\u2019s top problem (after getting an earful about soaring prices from their constituents on Main Street). But higher energy costs also act as a tax on consumers, who have less to spend after filling their vehicles\u2019 tanks. \nAnd petro prices could rise further, although J.P. Morgan\u2019s economics team, led by Bruce Kasman, tempered its bullish call for Brent crude, now saying it will top out at $110 a barrel. The group previously had forecast $150 crude, which it estimated would slam the world economy by severely slashing growth and boosting inflation.\nHelping to limit the rise were the \u201cmeasured\u201d sanctions announced by Washington. These spared energy supplies, while continuing Russia\u2019s access to global payment and settlement systems. In addition, the possible release of oil from strategic reserves and a potential reinstatement of the Iran nuclear agreement could further add to crude supplies, the J.P. Morgan report says.\nAfter the initial effect of lifting inflation readings, a 10% uptick in energy costs takes away 0.2% from consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, according to Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons. Consumers could try to get pay raises from their employers or dip into savings to maintain their spending, they write in a research note. Without those offsets, however, energy price hikes can be disinflationary, as has been the case in the past 20 years. \nThat has afforded the Fed the ability to look past oil price surges. Since the 1970s, the central bank hasn\u2019t reacted to rises in gasoline prices, writes T.S. Lombard\u2019s chief U.S. economist, Steve Blitz. Moreover, gasoline and other energy costs now take a smaller share of consumers\u2019 spending than they did in 2002\u20143.3% versus 5.3%\u2014he adds in a client note. \n \nWhat will matter more to the Fed is the stock market, Blitz continues. Its dip in reaction to prospective Fed tightening and Russia\u2019s attack probably means a quarter-point rate hike at next month\u2019s FOMC meeting, rather than a half-point. \nStock market corrections of more than 10% in recent history have meant that the Fed will stop raising rates or reverse course. Blitz cites the pause after an initial increase in early 2016 and the end of tightening at the end of 2018, when the S&P 500 stopped just short of a 20% bear-market drop. \nThat said, Blitz argues that the Fed is still far behind in raising rates to where they should be, given current and predicted future economic activity. He sees a transition from the Covid boom to an above-trend economic growth pace, with inflation settling in at 2.5% to 3%. That will be close enough to its 2% fed-funds target for the central bank to declare victory. This implies that fed funds will end at a \u201cterminal rate\u201d of 2.5%, he concludes. \nIf the Fed needs to raise its target by a smaller amount in coming months, it may be because financial conditions in the markets have tightened. In addition to the drop in stock prices, the spread between high-yield and Treasury bonds has widened while the dollar has firmed over geopolitical tensions, especially in recent sessions. But overall conditions remain easy, according to various measures, such as the Chicago Fed\u2019s National Financial Conditions Index. By December, it\u2019s virtually even money between fed-funds targets of 1.50% to 1.75% or 1.75% to 2%, according to the futures market betting. The odds had tilted toward the higher range earlier in February. \nYet the final message of the markets this past week might not be the inflation implied by rising costs for energy and other commodities, or the deflationary signals of the selloff in risky assets such as stocks. Rather, the signs of the worst of both worlds\u2014stagflation\u2014are visible in the market for Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. \nThe real, inflation-adjusted yield on five-year TIPS dropped sharply, to negative 1.26% on Thursday, from negative 1.04% earlier in the week, which would be associated with slower economic growth ahead. But the break-even inflation rate (the difference between the five-year Treasury note and the similar maturity) rose from 2.89% to 3.13%. That implies higher future inflation, and the number is more in line with various surveys, such as the New York Fed\u2019s consumer polling, which found a 3.5% expectation for the next three years.\nThat stagflationary outcome isn\u2019t too surprising, given sticky high oil prices, about which the Fed can do little, and supply shortages, plus the downshift in growth to an estimated 1.3% for the first quarter in the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Feb. 17 GDPNow estimate. That\u2019s down from the 7% unrevised fourth-quarter growth, 4.9 percentage points of which reflected inventory accumulation, according to Joshua Sharpiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR. \nThe future course of Fed policy had been the main thing on which Wall Street was focused. That was until Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine. Main Street may be less focused on geopolitics, but it could further ratchet up the prices paid at the gas pump and supermarket. So, the pain may be more equally distributed this time. \nWrite to Randall W. Forsyth at randall.forsyth@barrons.com"

If anything, after you have implemented a good plan, it requires being passive: doing next to nothing and letting your plan play out over years or decades.\nJack Bogle, founder and longtime CEO of The Vanguard Group, once advised investors to turn a bit of common wisdom on its head: \u201cDon\u2019t do something; just stand there.\u201d\nRead: Help your teenager turn $500 into nearly $2 million\nHere\u2019s what he meant: If you have a good long-term strategy, trying to micromanage it will almost certainly be counterproductive.\nThis flies in the face of our deep cultural value that success comes to those who work harder, putting in extra time and effort. But if you\u2019ve got a suitable investment plan, that extra effort may make you want to find a better fund, a better adviser, even a better plan.\nYou could join the many investors who constantly search the financial news hoping for insight into future trends and possible hot stocks.\nRead: To get rich investing, the power of time beats a lucky stock pick\nThe problem is that in today\u2019s world, information moves so easily and quickly, and greed is so rampant, that I can just about guarantee that before you learn about it, any low-risk and high-return investment will have already attracted many millions (if not billions) of dollars, driving up the price you would pay \u2014 and decreasing your potential profits.\nSo, if investors don\u2019t need grit, what do they really need?\nA big part of the answer is in the final chapter of a book that Richard Buck and I wrote a decade ago called\u00a0Financial Fitness Forever.\nThe chapter is called \u201cThe Perfect Investor.\u201d We wrote it because in the long run, what investors bring to the table is more important than the popular yet frustrating quest for \u201cthe perfect stock\u201d or \u201cthe perfect fund\u201d or \u201cthe perfect manager.\u201d\nOur discussion in that chapter was based on two weeks of interviews we did with all the financial advisers at Merriman Wealth Management (the company\u2019 current name), where we both worked and from which we are now both retired.\nCollectively, these advisers had spent tens of thousands of hours working with investors. We asked them what characteristics separated their most successful clients from their least successful ones.\nThe most successful investors weren\u2019t necessarily those with the most money or the flashiest jobs. Some \u201csecrets of success\u201d quickly emerged, and it turned out they weren\u2019t secrets at all.\nIt came down to two things: Habits and attitudes.\nAs we wrote, much of what we heard again and again \u201csounded like a description of attitudes and habits that contribute to success in life in general.\n\u201cThe \u2018perfect investor,\u2019 if such a person really exists, is somebody who plans for the future and is patient and deliberate in carrying out those plans.\u201d\nAttitudes\nOur attitudes shape our behavior almost automatically when we aren\u2019t watching. Here are four that our advisers identified:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trust in the future. This gives us confidence that someday we\u2019ll have a safe place to land despite today\u2019s turbulence.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resilience. Long-term investors repeatedly face setbacks, and resilience lets them pick themselves up and keep going. As Winston Churchill famously said many times: \u201cNo matter what, never give up.\u201d\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perspective. This trait helps us know the difference between what\u2019s really important and what just seems important at the moment.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patience. The most successful investors know time is their ally. They can wait for results. The least successful investors are often upset, impatient or elated, as the case may be, by whatever\u2019s happening at the moment.\nHabits\nWhile attitudes shape our thinking, habits govern our behavior, letting us move through life without having to think about the same issue again and again.\nSuccessful investors are in the habit of saving regularly and automatically. In our roundtable discussions, every adviser identified this as absolutely essential to long-term success.\u00a0\nThe best investors habitually find ways to delay gratification and live below their means. Some make it a point of pride to demonstrate they can live on less and still be happy.\nThe best investors acknowledge that they experience fear and greed, but they don\u2019t let those emotions govern what they do. They are the ones likely to be following Jack Bogle\u2019s advice: \u201cDon\u2019t do something; just stand there.\u201d\nCan you do all these things and get everything right? Maybe. Mostly, your habits and attitudes are in your control.\nHowever, the best investors don\u2019t expect or demand perfection. Pure perfection exists only in textbooks. We are fallible human beings, living in an imperfect world.\nSo give yourself a bit of slack. I haven\u2019t lived my life perfectly, and you won\u2019t live yours perfectly either.\nIf you do your best to do your best, and keep putting yourself back in the game, in the long run you\u2019ll be the best investor that you can be.\nI don\u2019t know how it gets better than that.\nFor more on perfection, check out\u00a0my latest podcast,\u00a0\u201cThe Perfect Investor.\u201d\nRichard Buck contributed to this article."

        "body": "This article is reprinted by permission from\u00a0NextAvenue.org.\nTraditional financial advice like the kind you got from your parents is often true but even experienced investors might rely on maxims that are outdated and no longer serving your financial well-being.\nIn fact, quite the opposite, as sticking to adages like \u201ccash is king\u201d (money is more valuable than other investments like stocks and bonds) and \u201call debt is bad\u201d may be financial relics that you can stand to update.\nHere are 5 money thoughts that you can ditch to keep a young financial mind:\nOne rule that may have become obsolete is paying down your mortgage faster than usual. With mortgage interest rates low, there\u2019s a good argument that putting that money elsewhere and earning a higher return over time may be a better bet than paying down your mortgage early. \u201cTrying to decide between eliminating debt and investing for the future can be a difficult decision,\u201d says Jason Laux, retirement adviser at\u00a0Synergy Group, a retirement planning firm\u00a0in White Oak, Penn.\n\u201cBut mortgage debt isn\u2019t always a bad thing. If you put off saving for retirement in order to pay off your mortgage early, you may end up house rich but cash poor,\u201d says Laux.\nInstead, prioritize your personal finances. Use any extra money to max out contributions to your 401(k) or IRA. \u201cSaving and investing for retirement is going to offer you a better return over time,\u201d Laux says.\nAlso see: Planning to retire early? Watch out for these tax traps\nOver the long run, holding significant amounts of\u00a0cash\u00a0ensures that you\u2019ll suffer significant lost opportunities, explains Robert R. Johnson, professor of finance at Heider College of Business, Creighton University, and the co-author of \u201cThe Tools and Techniques of Investment Planning, Strategic Value Investing and Investment Banking for Dummies.\u201d\nHe explains that when it comes to building wealth, you can either sleep well or eat well. If you invest conservatively, you sleep well because of little volatility. But it doesn\u2019t allow you to eat well because your account won\u2019t grow large enough to keep you well-fed.\u00a0\nRead: I\u2019ll be 65 soon, have $320,000 in retirement savings and a paid-off home but I\u2019m $46,000 in debt \u2013 should I take more money out of my investments?\nAccording to data compiled by Ibbotson Associates, large capitalization stocks (think S&P 500) returned 10.3% compounded annually from 1926 through 2020.\nOver that same time, long-term government bonds returned 5.5% annually and T-bills returned 3.3% annually.\u00a0To put it in perspective, $1 invested in the S&P 500 at the start of 1926 would have grown to $10,945 (with all dividends reinvested). That same dollar invested in T-bills would have grown to $21.71. \u201cThe surest way to build wealth over longtime horizons\u00a0is\u00a0to invest in a diversified portfolio of common stocks,\u201d says Johnson.\nTwenty years ago, if you had disposable income, you gave it to a financial adviser, who invested your money into safe, boring vehicles earning roughly 7% \u2013 10% a year, explains Stefan von Imhof, CEO of\u00a0alts.co, one of the world\u2019s largest alternative investing communities. \u201cToday, retail investors are increasingly shunning financial advisers, and managing investments themselves.\u201d\nImhof explains that a decade ago, 57% of households with $500,000+ in net worth and a prime earner under 45 years old had an investing style considered \u201cmostly self-directed.\u201d By 2019, that number has shot up to 70%.\n\u201cNew generations are self-educating and taking on higher levels of risk to get higher returns,\u201d says Imhof. They look to invest in alternatives, which usually aren\u2019t an option with mainstream advisers,\u201d he says. Today, managing your portfolio on your own or with light guidance from an occasional financial check-up with a professional may be the preferred way to go.\nAlso read: What 401(k) and IRA critics are missing\n\u201cSure, this advice will work for someone who plans on working until their mid to late 60s,\u201d says Ty Jones, a personal finance and retirement blogger who blogs at\u00a0AskTheSavingsGuy, a Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) advocacy blog, \u201cbut if you want to retire in your 50s, you\u2019ll need to save much more aggressively.\u201d\nBy saving 25% of your income, a 30-year-old with no retirement savings could reach their retirement goal by age 55 instead of age 63, which is what it would be if they were to contribute only 15% a year based on the 4% rule and assuming an 8% return. Bumping up your 10% retirement savings to 20% or 25% can ensure both a more robust retirement portfolio and allow for earlier retirement, explains Jones.\nSee: Is saving half your income hard? Saving 10% is even worse\nThis rule says you can spend 4% of your retirement funds annually and not run out of money. Johnson says, research, most notably by Wade\u00a0Pfau\u00a0of The American College of Financial Services, shows that while historically that rule of thumb worked in the U.S., the current environment of low bond returns increases the likelihood that retirees may well run out of money if that rule\u00a0is\u00a0applied going forward.\nJennifer Nelson\u00a0is a Florida-based writer who also writes for MSNBC, FOXnews and AARP.\u00a0\nThis article is reprinted by permission from\u00a0NextAvenue.org, \u00a9 2022 Twin Cities Public Television, Inc.

        "body": "Coinbase\u2019s Super Bowl roving QR code Super Bowl commercial may be as confusing to some people as its surprise entry into tax season.\nTax refunds typically arrive as either direct deposits to checking accounts or paper checks, and now they can get beamed into cryptocurrency portfolios, thanks to a new partnership between TurboTax and Coinbase COIN, -1.52%. \nTaxpayers who use TurboTax can ask to have their refunds deposited directly into a Coinbase account, where the money can be converted to more than 100 types of cryptocurrencies without trading fees, or it can sit in U.S. dollars, ready for future trades.\nBut just because people can receive their refund this way, should they? \nThis decision comes at a time when investment experts urge caution as volatile investments such as bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.13% and ethereum ETHUSD, +2.26% may or may not rebound from recent declines.\nThere are plenty of ways to use a tax refund in the market, financial advisers say. For example, a person could apply their refund directly to the purchase of U.S. savings bonds, known as I-Bonds, or they could take the direct deposit in cash and buy any array of stocks, bonds and investment assets.\nFinancial advisers say proceed with caution. \nCryptocurrency holdings can be a \u201cdecent diversifier\u201d and there are chances for future profits, said Todd Smith, owner of Level 5 Financial, a Colorado Spring, Colo. investment advisory firm. \nBut it\u2019s becoming too easy for people to put money into investments they don\u2019t fully understand, he said.\n \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a spot for cryptocurrency in a lot of people\u2019s portfolios right now.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cWith the extreme levels of volatility, especially with what we\u2019ve seen recently, your refund could immediately be halved, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Smith said.\nThe Coinbase-TurboTax offer provides an easy way to diversify into crypto, said Marisa Bradbury, a wealth advisor at Sigma Investment Counselors in the Greater Orlando area. Perhaps, too easy. \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a spot for cryptocurrency in a lot of people\u2019s portfolios right now,\u201d she said.\nIn fact, not many households are planning to pour their tax refund into the market. While 42% of people say they\u2019ll use their 2021 refund for savings, only 13% say they will invest it in the stock market, according to a NerdWallet poll of more than 2,000 people. \nIn similar NerdWallet NRDS, +5.17% polls over the last two years, just 10% of people said they\u2019d put the money in the market. \nMore than half of the people surveyed this year are expecting a refund and they are budgeting for an average $2,221, NerdWallet said. The average refund last year was approximately $2,800 according to IRS statistics.\nWhether it\u2019s cryptocurrency, I-Bonds or cash for the portfolio, here are the risks and rewards investors should consider now as they determine what\u2019s going to be next for their tax refund.\nWhen people file their 2021 income taxes through TurboTax INTU, -2.00%, they\u2019ll have the chance to send their tax refund money directly to their Coinbase COIN, -1.52% account, according to announcements last week from the tax preparation giant and the cryptocurrency exchange platform.\nSome or all of the tax refund can go to the Coinbase account. TurboTax users can divvy their refund in up to three different bank accounts, a spokeswoman noted.\nThe IRS has warned of a bumpy tax season with potential refund-processing delays, but TurboTax said there will not be extra administrative burdens in getting refunds to Coinbase accounts. \u201cThis will be processed just like a direct deposit into any other bank account,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n \u201c\u2018We\u2019re also committed to making tax season as easy as possible.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cCoinbase is committed to giving everyone instant and easy access to the cryptoeconomy,\u201d Bipul Sinha, Coinbase\u2019s senior product manager, said a blog post last week, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re also committed to making tax season as easy as possible.\u201d\nCoinbase did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment.\nThe ease of steering tax refund money towards cryptocurrency is also a downside, advisers say.\nSure, automated investing stops a person from spending money meant for other purposes, said Mark Struthers of Sona Wealth in Edina, Minn. But \u201ccrypto is a risky asset class. Any crypto investing should be well thought out and carefully planned.\u201d\n\u201cCrypto is very speculative so someone who needs that money or cannot afford to lose it should not be putting their tax refund there,\u201d said Lauren Gadkowski Lindsay of Beacon Financial Planning in Hyannis, Mass.\nPeople should also be aware of the potentially tricky tax headaches if they buy and sell crypto, but keep all their profits in their portfolio. \nSome regard crypto as an inflation hedge, but U.S. Savings Bonds, known as I-Bonds, don\u2019t get enough attention, some experts say \u2014 especially at a time when inflation is at its hottest point in decades.\nThese U.S. government bonds have a fixed rate of interest, plus an inflation index that gets recalculated every six months. I-Bonds purchased between now and April have a 7.12% rate.\nBacked by the full faith and credit of the federal government, these bonds are seen as a safe destination to park cash and take advantage of returns that could be higher than other low-risk investment vehicles like a high-yield savings account or a CD.\nFor roughly a decade, the IRS has allowed taxpayers to buy these bonds using their tax refund. An individual can buy up to $5,000 in I-Bonds using their tax refund money. \n \u201c\u2018I-bonds should be viewed more as a mid to long term investment vehicle.\u2019\u201d \nA tax refund being converted directly to cryptocurrency is \u201can extremely bad idea,\u201d said William Suplee of Structured Asset Management in Berwyn, Pan. But refund money for I-Bonds is \u201ca classic no-brainer\u201d and \u201can absolutely great layup.\u201d\n\u201cTry to find any other fixed income investment that pays this type of rate,\u201d Suplee said, pointing to the current 7.12% rate. The taxes on the interest come when the owner redeems the bonds and the interest is exempted from state and local taxes.\nBut these investments aren\u2019t the place for people who need quick access to their cash. It takes one year before these bonds can be redeemed for principal and accrued earnings. People who cash out before five years lose the previous three months of interest.\n\u201cI-bonds should be viewed more as a mid to long term investment vehicle, which may not align with an investor that has a shorter term time horizon,\u201d said Jonathan Kiehl of Evenkiehl, an investment advisory firm.\nA checking account is the preferred route for getting cash and figuring out the next investment steps, several financial advisers told MarketWatch. It\u2019s also the most common route for taxpayers. \nDirect deposit refunds accounted for over 90% of all refunds last tax season, IRS reports show. (For fastest receipt of refunds, the IRS advises households file electronically and arrange direct deposit.) \nThe upsides are the flexibility and choice to spend the money on whichever investments best fit a person\u2019s risk appetite and goals.\nBut there may be a downside too: people with cash in hand might suddenly get in the way of their own investing goals by spending the money elsewhere.\nThere are economic and emotional sides to decisions on how to spend any sum of money, including a tax tax refund, Smith noted. The best investment moves keep emotion in check, but Smith asks, \u201cCan you trust yourself to do that?\u201d\n\u201cA con with getting a check is the lack of an automatic investment being made; and therefore, the possibility that the money never actually gets invested,\u201d Kiehl said. \u201cLike salary deferrals, the most effective savings method is often the one that happens when we don\u2019t feel or see it leave our proverbial wallets.\u201d"

        "author": "Mark Hulbert",
        "body": "Many in the Gen Z generation who are of working age are essentially clueless about how to build up wealth over their lifetimes. A disturbingly large proportion of them have wildly unrealistic expectations about what they can achieve through their investing.\nConsider a recent survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers conducted in late September by MagnifyMoney. The results: 27% of Gen Zers said they hoped to retire before the age of 50. According to my analysis of the typical Gen Zer\u2019s financial situation, the chances are extremely remote that they will be able to retire that early \u2014 if at all.\nI reached that conclusion by projecting how much retirement wealth the typical Gen Zer will accumulate by the age of 50. I focused on a hypothetical 25-year old, which is the upper-end of the age range for the generation, and made the following assumptions:\nGiven these assumptions, this Gen Zer by the time she turns 50 will have amassed a portfolio worth about $607,000 in today\u2019s dollars. If she employs the standard 4% rule for yearly withdrawals from that portfolio, her annual income in retirement would be just over $24,000. That\u2019s about 40% of her annual income in the last year before retirement. (All these amounts are expressed in current dollars.)\nYet even this finding, sobering as it is, is too optimistic. That\u2019s because today\u2019s stock market is wildly overvalued, making it unlikely that it will produce a 6% inflation-adjusted annualized return in coming years. Each of eight valuation measures with a long-term record of success suggests that stocks\u2019 return in coming years will be below the historical average.\nSome object to this bearish conclusion on the grounds that long-ago U.S. history is not relevant to the current stock market. But this argument, while compelling on the surface, doesn\u2019t hold water. Consider what I found upon constructing a simple econometric model for each of the eight indicators, using only data back to 2000. On average they are projecting that the S&P 500 SPX, +2.24% over the next decade will produce an inflation-adjusted total return of minus 5.4%.\nIf this average projection is even close to being accurate, our hypothetical Gen Zer will be in far worse shape than in the simulation I reported above. Consider how much she will have to retire on assuming stocks\u2019 inflation-adjusted return in coming years is zero. In that case, she will have to live on less than $11,000 per year (in today\u2019s dollars) upon retiring at age 50.\nThere\u2019s more: The 4% rule is less applicable to those who retire before the traditional retirement age of 65. I explained why in a column this past summer. Basically, the odds of running out of money in retirement increase significantly as the number of years in retirement expand.\nMy analysis points to the crucial need to base our long-term financial plans on realistic assumptions. Not just Gen Zers, but all of us, are more likely to be financially comfortable in retirement to the extent we get an early start on a realistic financial plan.\nUnfortunately, many investors are not only unaware that their plans are unrealistic, they have closed off one of the major channels through which they could get a reality check. According to the MagnifyMoney website, just 21% of respondents in their survey indicated that they currently are working with a financial adviser \u2014 and more than half (54%) said they have no plans to do so. This suggests to me that there is a dangerous level of overconfidence among investors about building up retirement wealth.\nThe study of history provides us with the opportunity to learn before it\u2019s too late. With the stock and bond markets at or near all-time highs, now is the perfect time to do so.\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

She\u2019s the first person to be nominated to the court who has been a criminal defense attorney\u00a0since Justice Thurgood Marshall\u00a0was on the court and he\u2019s been off the court over 30 years now.\nShe is supremely qualified. She has not just an elite education\u2014she went to Harvard for both college and law school\u2014she clerked for the\u00a0retiring justice whose place she will take, Stephen Breyer. Beyond that, she has been in private practice, she\u2019s\u00a0been on the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u00a0and she\u2019s been\u00a0both a trial court and appellate judge.\n So she\u2019s seen the profession from a variety of perspectives that will inform her decisions.\nI imagine it will help her understand the very real human toll of our criminal justice system. The U.S. is\u00a0far and away the world\u2019s largest jailer, with around\u00a02 million people incarcerated in jails and prisons and 4 million more\u00a0under criminal justice supervision like probation or parole. \nThe criminal justice system takes an enormous toll on both people in the system and their loved ones. I believe having a Supreme Court justice who is familiar with that is incredibly valuable.\nIn addition, having represented people facing accusations from the government, she knows that the government does not always get things right. That may mean that she has a healthy skepticism of the government\u2019s version of things, which is important for ensuring fairness in our judicial system.\nHer presence on the court will not necessarily swing the outcome of high-profile cases. But she\u2019s also not Justice Breyer\u2019s clone. I think having her voice on the court will certainly still be valuable, and again, she brings different life experiences to the bench that will inform her decision-making.\nThere was one case during the Trump administration involving\u00a0whether the White House counsel could be required to testify\u00a0in the House of Representatives. One of the notable things that she said in that opinion was that \u201cpresidents are not kings.\u201d She ruled that in our constitutional government, people have to abide by the rules and the White House counsel could not be excused from complying with the House subpoena simply because the president didn\u2019t want him to.\nI\u2019m teaching constitutional law right now and this is a classic clash between Congress and the executive branch\u2014a fight for control and how much Congress should be able to inquire into the president\u2019s activities. This is not a radical opinion that marks a major departure from precedent or other recent decisions.\nI don\u2019t think her being a Black woman necessarily tells us anything about how she\u2019ll rule on a particular case. But we all know that judges bring their lived experiences to the bench. She has experienced the world in a way that is different from everyone else on the Supreme Court\u2014even though she has plenty in common with other members on the court.\nResearch from the business world\u00a0suggests that diverse groups make better decisions, in part because people challenge each other. They don\u2019t necessarily have the same blind spots or see things the same way. I\u2019m wondering how that will carry over to the Supreme Court.\nI\u2019ve heard justices say before that any time a new member joins the court, it\u2019s a new court, that the dynamic shifts. From a generational perspective, there may be things that are important to her that are different than they were for Justice Breyer. I think having some youthful energy on the court can be useful, if it counts as youthful energy to have a 51-year-old added to the Supreme Court.\nMaybe she has a more detailed or nuanced understanding of, say, social media, and how it operates. Maybe she has younger people in her life, who can inform her about those things and provide a different perspective than the members of the court who are a little bit older.\nA new justice means there\u2019s a new court, even if the ideological balance doesn\u2019t necessarily shift. This is a really interesting time to watch the Supreme Court, because the majority on the court right now is willing to question things that seemed like they were settled for a long time. For example, although\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0seemed to be settled law, we\u2019re going to find out soon whether a majority of the court agrees.\nSimilarly, earlier this year, when the\u00a0court barred implementation of OSHA\u2019s COVID vaccine mandate for large businesses, it resurrected a doctrine that had been moribund for decades.\nSo I\u2019m excited to see how her addition to the court will change things, both with the high-profile blockbuster cases, and the ones that tend to fly under the radar.\nAlexis Karteron is an associate professor of law at Rutgers University \u2014 Newark, where she is director of the Rutgers Constitutional Rights Clinic.

And at 51, she would be the second-youngest justice after Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett, who is 50.\u00a0\nRead more: Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden\u2019s Supreme Court pick, once sided with Trump on his border wall\nHer talking points appeared to be appealing to people across the country. She repeatedly expressed her love for the U.S. and the Constitution; she credited God and her faith for her blessings in life; and she noted that she has family in Florida and in law enforcement.\u00a0\n\u201cI must begin these very brief remarks by thanking God for delivering me to this point in my professional journey,\u201d she began. \u201cMy life has been blessed beyond measure, and I do know that one can only come this far by faith.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd in counting her blessings, Jackson said that the very first was the fact that she was born in the U.S. in the first place. \u201cThe United States of America is the greatest beacon of hope and democracy the world has ever known,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nShe noted that her father \u2014 who has been married to her mother for 54 years, and now resides in Florida \u2014 set her on the legal path when he pivoted from being a high school history teacher, to going to law school.\u00a0\nAnd she pointed out that while she has an uncle \u201cyou may have read\u201d about, \u201cwho got caught up in the drug trade\u201d and received a life sentence \u2014 she also has a brother who is a Baltimore police officer and detective. She also listed uncles who are in law enforcement, including one who became the police chief in her hometown of Miami.\u00a0\n\u201cLaw enforcement also runs in my family,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nAnd Jackson also thanked Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, whose place she would be potentially filling on the bench, who \u201cgave me the greatest job that any young lawyer could ever hope to have\u201d when she clerked for him during a term that began in 1999. She praised his \u201cgrace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit,\u201d before saying that while she may one day take his seat (if the Senate confirms her, anyway), she could never fill his shoes.\u00a0\nShe closed her remarks by sharing a curious coincidence: She has the same birthday as Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to ever be appointed as a federal judge. \u201cWe were born exactly 49 years to the day apart,\u201d Jackson said, adding that she stands on Motley\u2019s shoulders \u201csharing not only her birthday, but also her steadfast and courageous commitment to equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019m fortunate enough to be confirmed as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d she continued, \u201cI can only hope that my life and career, my love of this country and the Constitution, and my commitment to upholding the rule of law and the sacred principles upon which this great nation is founded, will inspire future generations of Americans.\u201d\u00a0\nJackson\u2019s name and \u201cSupreme Court\u201d were trending on Google and Twitter throughout the day on Friday.\u00a0\nSo what\u2019s next? Once the White House transmits Jackson\u2019s nomination to Capitol Hill, the Senate Judiciary Committee will send her a questionnaire to begin the vetting process. At the same time, she will begin setting up meetings with any senators who want to meet her for private conversations before the confirmation hearing. And Senators will spend the next few weeks reading up on Jackson\u2019s background, career and her decisions and opinions as a federal judge.\nHer confirmation hearing, which is expected to last around four days, could begin as soon as mid-March.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

        "subtitle": "Analyzing all 10% declines in the stock market of the last century",
        "date": "2022-02-25 13:32:00",
        "author": "Mark Hulbert",
        "body": "There\u2019s a 61% chance that the stock market correction will not turn into a full-fledged bear market.\nI\u2019m referring to the semiofficial definitions of \u201ccorrection\u201d and \u201cbear market\u201d as declines from a stock market peak of at least 10% and 20%, respectively. The S&P 500 SPX, +2.24% satisfied the correction criterion this past Tuesday, when it closed 10.3% below its Jan. 3 closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.51% so far has avoided slipping into correction territory, but only by the smallest of margins.\nThere\u2019s no way of knowing whether the market is close to a bottom and will now rally to new all-time highs, or continue declining and subsequently enter bear-market territory. But it is possible to analyze past market declines in order to calculate the probabilities of each.\nThat\u2019s what I did for this column. From various sources I constructed a list of all stock market declines of at least 10% since the 1920s. Of the 54 declines on the list, 33 did not become eventual bear markets and 21 did. So if the future is like the past, there is a 61% chance (33 out of 54) that the stock market decline we\u2019re currently experiencing will not continue to the point of becoming a bear market.\nYour reaction to this will depend on whether you see the glass as half full or half empty. The pessimists among you will note that there is a 39% chance that the correction that began this week will become a bear market, while the optimists will fasten onto the 61% odds that it will not.\nIs the risk of a bear market high enough to justify reducing your equity exposure? Only you can decide what is appropriate, given your risk tolerance. But I would note that the risk of a bear market isn\u2019t significantly higher now than at any other time.\nConsider the percentage of days since 1900 that have occurred during a bear market. Based on a bear-market calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research, this percentage is 33%, not significantly lower than the 39% probability I calculate that the current correction will become a bear market.\nWhat makes a correction turn into a bear market?\nWhy do some corrections morph into a bear market and some do not? Analysts from time immemorial have tackled that question, and a definitive answer remains elusive.\nTake the cyclically-adjusted price/earnings (CAPE) ratio, which was made famous by Yale University finance professor (and Nobel laureate) Robert Shiller. It is perhaps the most popular indicator of stock market valuation, and you might very well wonder if those corrections that became bear markets had higher CAPE ratios at their starts than those that did not.\nYes, but not by enough to write home about. At the beginnings of those corrections that did not become bear markets, the median CAPE ratio was 17.9. At the beginnings of those that did become bear markets, in contrast, the median CAPE was 18.3. This difference was not significant at the 95% confidence level that statisticians often use when determining if a pattern is genuine.\nI reached a similar conclusion when testing the ability of the traditional (unadjusted) P/E ratio to predict which corrections would become bear markets.\nIn other words, despite whatever other insights that the CAPE and P/E ratios can provide us about the current stock market, they can\u2019t help us guess whether the current stock market correction will be like the 61% of past corrections that did not become bear markets\u2014or like the 39% that did.\nThe bottom line? The risk of a bear market is not insignificant. But, then, it\u2019s always considerable. We\u2019ve always known that stocks\u2019 higher long-term return is compensation for incurring that risk. What\u2019s happened since the beginning of the year has reacquainted us with this risk in a very practical, non-theoretical way.\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

But if you want to make them frown (and why would you?), here\u2019s a downer topic: nursing homes.\nAlmost no healthy person in their 70s, 80s or 90s hopes to move into a nursing home as they age. The very idea fills them with dread.\nIn a recent poll of older adults, 71% said they\u2019re unwilling to live in a nursing home in the future. And\u00a057% of respondents said that COVID influenced whether they\u2019d be willing to live in a nursing home.\nRead: Aging in place is even harder in small towns or rural areas\n\u201cNursing homes all get painted with the same brush,\u201d said Terry Fulmer, Ph.D., president of\u00a0the\u00a0John A. Hartford Foundation, which conducted the survey. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help that the media kept calling them \u2018death traps\u2019 early on with COVID.\u201d\nEven before March 2020, most seniors wanted to \u201cage in place\u201d in their home. It\u2019s hard to feel optimistic about the years ahead when you fear winding up in a charmless, understaffed facility.\nRead: CEO who built new model for senior care resigns amid regulatory scrutiny\n\u201cYou see people slumped in a wheelchair napping by the nurse\u2019s station,\u201d said Gail Samaha, founder of GMS Associates, a senior advisory firm in Scituate, Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s not an uplifting environment.\u201d\nYet as much as seniors resist the notion of landing in a nursing home, many do. In 2020, nearly 1.3 million people lived in nursing facilities in the U.S. \nThe popular perception of institutional care settings reinforces the notion that they\u2019re undesirable. The high incidence of COVID deaths of residents and staff over the last two years hasn\u2019t helped.\nRead: \u2018Caregivers are getting burned out by the pandemic\u2019: Labor shortages are taking a huge toll on nursing homes\nBut some industry observers see a sea change in the evolution of these facilities.\n\u201cA lot of folks look back at the old stereotype where nursing homes are these sterile places with white walls and floors and drooling residents,\u201d said Kristi Stalder, author of \u201cNavigating Assisted Living.\u201d \u201cBut in recent years, there has been a concentrated effort to change the stereotype.\u201d\nRead: Aging in place can be a nightmare if you\u2019re not properly prepared\nOver the last two decades, the nomenclature has evolved to reflect ever-expanding care models. The term \u201clong-term-care community\u201d is displacing \u201cnursing home,\u201d Stalder says, to convey a more positive environment. People with dementia move into \u201cmemory care\u201d facilities.\nFurthermore, the term \u201cnursing home\u201d sometimes describes skilled nursing facilities, which provide care for individuals recovering from a medical condition such as a stroke. The patient\u2019s long-term plan may be to return home after completing rehab.\nRead: Profits and Pain: Backed by D.C. power players and private equity, a healthcare provider is under scrutiny for failing fragile seniors\nAn elderly person with a chronic medical ailment who needs hands-on care can remain at home. But it will take a village of helpers (paid aides as well as supportive family and friends) to make it work.\nHowever well intentioned, such arrangements can prove exhausting to manage and sustain over time. If the older person lives alone, isolation can take a toll.\nThe socialization that comes from living among others, as well as having aides and nurses nearby, can offset some of the negatives of institutional care. That\u2019s why Stalder addresses seniors\u2019 resistance to move head-on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I ask them to tour a long-term-care community so that they can see it for themselves.\u201d\nIf your parents vow to remain at home until they die, don\u2019t pick a fight. It\u2019s better to dignify their concerns rather than rush to suggest a possible move.\n\u201cYou have to understand the goals, values and preferences of your parent and harmonize it with what you think,\u201d said Fulmer, who\u2019s also a registered nurse. She urges families to discuss these issues early on\u2014before a crisis hits\u2014so that all parties agree on an action plan under various scenarios.\nBrace for conflict during these conversations. Expect your siblings (and parents) to express clashing opinions, at least at first. Educating everyone about the different housing options\u2014and identifying nearby facilities that might merit a visit\u2014helps demystify the process.\nLike many businesses, nursing homes are struggling to hire and retain staff. When you tour facilities, ask about staffing ratios and employee turnover.\n\u201cThere are major shortages of CNAs [certified nursing assistants] and nurses are retiring,\u201d Samaha said.\nAn exercise buff, Samaha is in her late 60s. She counts herself among the many baby boomers who want to stay put.\n\u201cI put a lot of money and time into my health,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move into a nursing home. That\u2019s the last place I\u2019d want to be.\u201d"

        "body": "As we recognize Black History Month, it\u2019s a good time to pause and reflect on the financial gaps that put many diverse Americans at a financial disadvantage. While the work that must be done will be nothing short of tectonic to truly solve these challenges, there are actions we can take in our own individual finances to help us reach our personal goals while also supporting values around diversity. \u00a0\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to start, here are simple steps to help align your financial choices with your values\u2014whether that means focusing on raising up yourself, your family, or the wider community.\nHaving clear, specific financial goals is important for anyone developing a sound financial plan, but even more so for Black households when you consider many start out already behind: The\u00a0median wealth gap of Black families\u00a0holding 12 cents per $1 of White wealth is largely unchanged over the past 30 years. On average, Black households earn 61 cents for every dollar of income earned by white households. Black college graduates hold an average of $23,400 in loan debt, vs. $16,000 for their white peers. And financial this inequity can compound over time, with white Americans on average holding seven times the amount of retirement savings as Black Americans.\nMaking progress in your personal finances can feel like an uphill battle, but it\u2019s possible to pursue your personal aspirations while balancing your support for the people and causes you care about. Get started by checking in with your employer about financial planning or coaching tools that might be available at work. Taking advantage of workplace benefits can help you get your immediate needs addressed, and help you free up additional funds to set aside for other, broader goals like education, charitable giving, or retirement.\nGiven the unique challenges facing the Black community today, access to financial education has never been more important. And \u201cfirst generation\u201d professionals in many fields may not have learned from their families and friends how to manage wealth-building resources like equity compensation or investing. \nDemystifying financial empowerment\u2014and bringing wealth-building opportunities\u2014into diverse communities can help spark change individually. Start small: Many workplace financial educational modules and sessions focus on helping you learn the ropes of basic financial planning, investing, and making the most of any equity award benefits you have. Tap into these benefits to better understand your own finances, as well as how you can align your money with your values. Also plug in to employee resource groups to learn more, share more, and understand how some of these issues play a role in wider social issues.\nParticipating and educating yourself is the first step: Putting it to use is the next. Take what you learn into your community, whether through volunteering, mentoring, or recruiting efforts for your company.\nInvesting can help you protect your future\u2014putting you in a stronger position to help the people and causes you care about. In a 2020 survey, just 36% of Black Americans said they had money in the stock market\u2014including in a 401(k) or other retirement account\u2014compared with 60% of white Americans.\nExplore the retirement plan options available to you at work and take advantage of any employer matching. Also consider other investment options that can help build wealth over time. For example, you can work with a financial adviser to build a portfolio of investments that focuses on companies promoting workplace equality, access to capital, and products and services that benefit diverse communities, while avoiding exposure to companies with poor diversity records. Your workplace benefits may help you access financial coaching or advice to help you get started.\nMake your personal financial stability a priority\nIndividual financial choices can help make a difference. Putting yourself in a stronger position gives you more room to help uplift diverse families and communities. Prioritize your personal financial stability and your plan first, and don\u2019t be shy in plugging into support through your workplace benefits as you look for ways to turn your values into action.\n\u00a0Rodney Bolden is vice president, Financial Wellness at Morgan Stanley at Work.\nThis article has been prepared for informational purposes only.

        "body": "Work, how many ways do I loathe thee?\nThis is a question being asked by employees who have either quit their jobs or displayed a reluctance to rejoin the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other people love their job \u2014 or like it, at the very least \u2014 and are seeking a more flexible work life where they can spend more time with family.\nWith office space lying empty \u2014 or vastly underused \u2014 across the country, millions of Americans are left with the bare bones of their work, a kettle and a Zoom ZM, -1.30% screen if they\u2019re lucky. And they\u2019re also left with questions: What do I get from my job? Who am I without it? Is it worth it? What else is out there waiting for me?\nStephen Crain, 50, worked as an electrical engineer for 26 years in the Minneapolis area. He is one such employee who just called it quits. But he did not loathe is job. In fact, he had a much happier story: Crain handed in his notice on Tuesday to help his wife out with her growing business.\nEllen, his wife, started a standardized testing business, Homeschool Boss, five years ago. During the pandemic, the demand for homeschooling increased significantly as more parents started working from home and/or moved out of cities and, crucially, away from their children\u2019s school districts. \nThe business was born from their own experience homeschooling their three children. \u201cYear after year, we\u2019d go searching for a good test that would give good feedback and direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe options out there weren\u2019t any good. They were 20 years out of date, bulky and slow.\u201d\nHis employer was surprised that he quit, but they remain on good terms, and he is currently working out his two weeks notice before turning his attentions to Homeschool Boss. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be able to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe seem to have won the rare pandemic lottery with her choice of business pursuits.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018We seem to have won the rare pandemic lottery with her choice of business pursuits.\u2019\u201d \nThe risk of exposure to COVID-19 is one salient and ever-present factor in people choosing to work but \u2014 as Stephen Crain\u2019s story shows \u2014 there are a myriad other reasons underpinning the so-called Great Resignation, and not all of them involve bored, unhappy or even aggrieved workers. \nThe \u201cquit rate\u201d fell slightly in December to 4.3 million, dropping 161,000 quits from the previous month, but the rate was little changed at 2.9%. Quits are typically voluntary separations initiated by the employee and serve as a measure of workers\u2019 willingness or ability to leave jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTo put that in context,\u00a0there were more than 47 million people who called it quits last year, and Stephen Crain\u2019s story was just one of them. Employers reported 10.9 million job openings in December. There is, perhaps, no greater motivator than a global pandemic \u2014 aside from a war \u2014 to remind people that life is short. \nIn an effort to cast more light on worker sentiment, Gallup asked more than 13,000 U.S. employees what was most important to them when deciding whether to accept a new job. Respondents listed six factors, said Ben Wigert, the director of research and strategy for Gallup\u2019s workplace management practice.\nA significant rise in income or benefits was the No. 1 reason, followed by greater work-life balance and better personal wellbeing, the ability to do what they do best, greater stability and job security, COVID-19 vaccination policies that align with their beliefs, and the organization\u2019s diversity and inclusivity of all types of people.\n\u201cCompensation is naturally intertwined with development, growth, reward and recognition,\u201d Wigert said. \u201cAnd we have all had a crash course in the importance of wellbeing in our work and home lives.\u201d In fact, a separate report released this week said 1 in 4 people who considered quitting cited their mental health as the reason.\n \nQuitting affects morale. No one likes to look over the row of computers in their office silo and see the remnants of where that always optimistic Mary-Jane or grouchy, but lovable Harry once sat. There\u2019s nothing sadder than a rogue Post-it from happier times. And there\u2019s nothing more unsettling than being left behind.\nThere are ways companies can help reduce the number of quits. \u201cManagers should be trained to have this conversation and \u2018pay with purpose,\u2019\u201d Wigert added. \u201cEmployees need to feel valued for their contributions and have an individual development plan that defines a path for future growth opportunities.\u201d\nBut here\u2019s one of the biggest misconceptions about the workplace. Your manager, like your mother or father or pastor or rabbi, are not hatched from an egg as a perfect human being. They have good days or bad days, shortcomings and strengths. Silent grumbling will only lead to resentments, and then less-silent office gossip.\nEmployees should also seek support rather than waiting for the company to provide it, Tessa West, a New York University social psychology professor with a particular interest in the workplace behavior, told MarketWatch. \u201cHaving a good friend at work is the biggest predictor of happiness,\u201d she said.\nWorkplace friendships can sour quickly. \u201cIf any kind of competition comes along or favoritism it can really screw up a friendship. It\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s hard to date at work because of the power. That dynamic alters our relationship in ways that we don\u2019t like and ways we don\u2019t expect,\u201d she added.\n \u201c\u2018It\u2019s important for employers to show up as a stabilizing force employees can count on through thick and thin.\u2019\u201d \nEmployees, particularly those who lower paid, are likely to underestimate how much more money they could earn elsewhere, according to this study by economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, London School of Economics, University of Cologne and University of California, Berkeley.\nEconomists at Barclays led by Michael Gapen say the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d is a red herring. \u201cInstead, the true cause is a hesitation of workers to return to the labor force, due to influences tied to the pandemic such as infection risks, infection-related illness, and a lack of affordable child care,\u201d they said. \nAnother less-talked-about reason for quitting: Over 80% of American workers polled by Goodhire, an employment screening company, said they might quit their job because of a bad manager. And 1.3% of employees at large U.S. companies describe their company\u2019s culture as toxic or poisonous, a Glassdoor survey said.\n\u201cWhat does this mean for companies? It means that toxicity is the kiss of death,\u201d Charlie Sull, co-founder of CultureX, a human-resources technology company that uses artificial intelligence to measure and improve corporate culture, wrote in a recent column for MarketWatch. \nWhy should this be a bigger deal now than pre-pandemic? People have less emotional bandwidth to deal with such shenanigans. \u201cEven a whiff of toxicity will send employees running. Maybe they would have put up with it a couple of years ago; after the COVID-19 pandemic, they will not,\u201d he added.\n \nHowever, moving because of a bad boss or coworker can be a mistake, because you\u2019re assuming that the smiling, seemingly happy people at your new job will welcome you with open arms, West said. On the contrary, they may have developed long-simmering resentments with their own corporate culture.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to become a partner at a law firm? The snake in a suit, the classic sociopathic behavior?\u201d West said. \u201cGetting to the top does require some of this jerkery. The dark secret is that it is, at least to some degree, encouraged. We\u2019re like rats in a cage. If you reward that behavior, they\u2019re going to get better and quicker.\u201d\nIntentionally or not, corporate culture rewards Machiavellianism, she added. For those who are privileged enough to work from home, not everyone is eager to get back to the office \u2014 and the office politics. West said it\u2019s important to speak up and change the culture of your company from within, but also look at your own actions.\nWest said it\u2019s important to invite feedback from colleagues on a regular basis. \u201cThere is a norm against giving unsolicited negative feedback, especially someone who is at the same level as you. You really have to learn how to ask for it in a way that defangs it, and won\u2019t be super painful, and you won\u2019t be threatened.\u201d\nOffice meetings are the Serengeti of office politics. \u201cThe minute everyone is emotionally invested in the outcome, people\u2019s true colors come out. Being a bulldozer, credit stealer, gaslighter or threatening the boss behind the scenes to make sure their priorities align. I\u2019ve seen the nicest people do all those things.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Getting to the top in the U.S. does require some of this jerkery. The dark secret is that it is, at least to some degree, encouraged.\u2019\u201d \nWhile it\u2019s routine for outgoing employees to give feedback during an exit interview, workers often don\u2019t think they could be the jerk at the office \u2014 or act like one. \u201cPeople assume everything is going to be newer and shinier, but it\u2019s not,\u201d said West, author of \u201cJerks at Work: Toxic Coworkers and What to Do About Them.\u201c\nIf you stay? \u201cYou get into a situation where people are fighting over the dishes, but they\u2019re not fighting over the dishes, they\u2019re fighting over something that happened 10 years ago. We\u2019re dealing with institutional memory loss when we move workplaces. It\u2019s going to result in a lot of horizontal moves over five or six years.\u201d\nCrain, thankfully, does not have to deal with any of those issues with his own transition from full- to part-time work. But he does admit feeling a mixture of terror and excitement, probably not an unusual combination in these circumstances. \u201cThe terror and excitement ping-pongs between us,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to helping his wife out with her business part-time, he and Ellen have started taking pottery classes. Who knows? Fate may intervene again and provide another opening in the market. \u201cI expect to make enough pottery to where I need to give it away \u2014 or sell it,\u201d he said.\nUltimately, his own reason for quitting was simple. \u201cHer goal was to replace my income. I said, \u2018How can I help?\u2019\u201d Crain said he knows that he is one of the fortunate quitters. First, he collected his annual bonus before giving his notice. (Obviously.) Second, he has confidence in the success of his wife\u2019s enterprise. \nA unique set of circumstances led Crain to handing in his notice. He realizes how fortunate he is to have this opportunity. Millions more people can only dream. Friends have congratulated him on retiring at 50. When they do, he gives credit where credit is due: \u201cI\u2019m only able to do this because of what she accomplished.\u201d\n "

        "body": "White men who face certain obstacles in life are better able to see white privilege \u2014\u00a0and that recognition could translate to support for policies to tackle racial inequities, new research says.\nWhite men who say they\u2019ve experienced social disadvantages in the workplace based on their socioeconomic status, disability, age, sexual orientation or religion are more likely than their white male counterparts who had not experienced such disadvantages to recognize white privilege, according to a new paper published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes.\nResearchers from Cornell, Duke and Tulane Universities conducted 10 studies with more than 5,100 people in the U.S. and U.K., examining white men\u2019s perceptions of white privilege in the workplace and their experiences of disadvantages based on a social category.\nUltimately, they found that \u201cthe experience of disadvantage can provide enlightenment on white privilege,\u201d study co-author Ashleigh Shelby Rosette, a professor of management and organizations at Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, told MarketWatch. \n \u201c\u2018Although white men sit atop of two of the most predominant hierarchies \u2014 race and gender \u2014 they are not a monolithic group.\u2019\u201d \nIn other words, she said, white men\u2019s experience of disadvantage on one social hierarchy can help them see their advantage on another.\n\u201cAlthough white men sit atop of two of the most predominant hierarchies \u2014 race and gender \u2014 they are not a monolithic group,\u201d Rosette said. \u201cWe wanted to explore how other subordinate identities, and the corresponding experience of disadvantage because of those identities, would influence how they viewed their status atop the racial hierarchy.\u201d\nThe study defined white privilege as economic and social advantages that white people experience and racial minorities do not \u2014 advantages that come about \u201cthrough no merit of your own, purely because of race,\u201d as Rosette put it. These can crop up in myriad places, she added, including housing, schools, healthcare and corporate America.\nAs MarketWatch has previously reported, many people in the U.S. tend to deny or rationalize facts about systemic inequality and privilege. Though inequality has increased in recent decades, concerns about it have declined, and many people continue to believe that the country is a meritocracy where success comes to individuals who work for it.\nRead more: Racial and economic inequality persists. Why do many people deny it?\nRosette, for her part, noted that the idea of privilege can feel \u201cquite threatening\u201d to some of the core values central to American society, including individual achievement and merit. But white privilege doesn\u2019t exist in lieu of personal achievement, she added; it works in tandem.\n\u201cIn society and in organizations, you can have at least two systems that are working in tandem: a system based on individual merit and a system based on privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cOftentimes, we want to only acknowledge one \u2026\u00a0but just because we don\u2019t acknowledge that other system doesn\u2019t mean that it does not exist.\u201d\nRosette and her co-authors invoked a 2019 quote by U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a white gay man who was mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a 2020 presidential candidate, from when he was challenged during a Democratic presidential debate about his outreach to Black voters.\nIn his response \u2014 which inspired some controversy at the time \u2014\u00a0Buttigieg said, \u201cwhile I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn\u2019t have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience,\u201d he added.\nBroadly speaking, the study\u2019s findings suggest that \u201cat least among White men, an enhanced perspective of the social hierarchy coupled with positive self-evaluation may spur a desire to generate social change,\u201d the authors wrote.\u00a0\nThis is important because white men continue to hold a disproportionate share of influential positions in society, they added. A 2020 New York Times analysis of the 922 most powerful people in government, top-valued public companies, academia, media, entertainment and sports, for example, found that 80% were white.\u00a0Studies also show men are overrepresented in top leadership roles across industries. \n\u201cTherefore, to the extent that perceiving privilege leads White men and other members of dominant groups to support progressive social policies and the reduction of existing inequities, that support may generate tangible, positive outcomes for racial minorities and others that suffer from social inequity in America (and abroad),\u201d the researchers said.\nRelated: America\u2019s most prestigious corporate boards are still being filled by mostly white men"

        "author": "Andrew Keshner",
        "body": "This year was sizing up to be a very good one for domestic and international travel, as some forecasters said passengers were going to keep stepping out to see the world after the pandemic halted so many trips in 2020.\nBut with spring and summer\u2019s warm weather around the corner, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine throws a violent new question mark into those travel plans abroad \u2014 just as the attack has roiled everything from the stock market to everyday gas prices.\nWhen it comes to travel, one thing is clear: At a time when prices are already climbing, observers say there\u2019s a chance for even steeper airfare prices that eventually soak up higher jet fuel prices.\nOn Thursday, U.S. crude settled at $92.81 a barrel after touching the $100 mark earlier in the day. Airlines hedge fuel prices, committing to buying a certain amount of fuel in the future at a predetermined price. So any immediate rise in oil prices won\u2019t be passed onto passengers right away.\nBut fuel prices are only going in one direction. Last week, the price of jet fuel was more than $107/barrel, according to the International Air Transport Association. That\u2019s a nearly 4% increase from a month ago and up almost 57% from a year ago, the trade organization said.\n \u201cLast week, the price of jet fuel was more than $107/barrel. That\u2019s a nearly 4% increase from a month ago and up almost 57% on the year.\u201d \n\u201cHigher oil prices, if they are sustained, are going to show up in travelers\u2019 ticket prices,\u201d said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights, which scours ticket prices to find deals for its members. \nJet fuel is derived from crude oil and fuel is an airline\u2019s second largest operating expense behind labor, explained professor Bijan Vasigh, an economist at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical\u00a0University who teaches and writes on the aviation industry\u2019s finances. \nWith fuel being such a major expense for an airline, \u201chigher oil prices would translate to higher ticket prices,\u201d Vasigh said. As a result, carriers would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to pass on some of those costs, he said. \n \nIt\u2019s too early to know how much Russia\u2019s invasion will increase jet fuel, and when when those price increases will be noticeable, said Vasigh. But the conflict is coming a time when jet fuel prices historically increase in order to meet increased seasonal demand from May to mid-September, Vasigh noted. \nSome passengers going to Asian and Middle Eastern destinations may also have to travel longer because they are traveling more circuitous routes to avoid the vast Russian airspace, Keyes said. Longer routes require more fuel and more labor costs, which could find their way back into ticket prices, he said.\nUkraine on Thursday closed off its airspace for civilian flights while Russia closed some portions of its airspace, according to Reuters.\n\u201cThe presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels,\u201d the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said. \nAirlines were warned not to fly over Ukraine, or in Belarus or Russia within 100 nautical miles of Ukraine\u2019s borders. \u201cIn particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft,\u201d it added.\nPoland\u2019s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday that it\u2019s preparing to close the country\u2019s airspace to Russian airlines. On Thursday, the U.K. banned the Russian flag airline Aeroflot from landing there, and on Friday Russia banned British air carriers from crossing its airspace or landing at Russian airports. \nAirfares were already increasing as more people got back on flights in 2021.Last year, U.S. airlines carried 670.4 million passengers, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. \nThat\u2019s an 83% increase from the roughly 300 million passengers who flew in 2020 during the height of the pandemic, but a 27% decrease from the roughly 916 million passengers in 2019.\nInternational travelers accounted for 9% of last year\u2019s passengers, the agency noted.\n \u201cSome 1.75 million travelers passed through TSA checkpoints on Wednesday, double the amount from the same time last year.\u201d \nThe same trends can be seen now: 1.75 million travelers passed through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on Wednesday. That\u2019s more than double the amount from the same time last year, but under the 2 million mark from the same point in 2020, just before COVID-19 was officially declared a global pandemic. \nAs flights bounced back, so did prices. Travelers paid an average $314 for domestic airfare in 2021\u2019s third quarter, according to the agency. When adjusting for inflation, that\u2019s up from around $250 a year earlier.\nSo far in February, the average cost of international airfare is $681, according to data from Hopper.com. That\u2019s also up from the $647 average in January, but down from $756 in December and $783 averages in November, two big months for holiday travel.\nLike so much else in the unfolding conflict, Keyes said the future is unknown on its implications for international travel.\nOn the margins, some travelers might be re-thinking plans to Europe and Russia, but right now he doesn\u2019t see the conflict squelching demand. \u201cI would be surprised if travel demand diminishes. It just might end up getting redirected somewhat,\u201d said Keyes.\nEarlier Thursday, Glenn Fogel, CEO of Booking.com BKNG, -0.59% told CNBC that Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine was \u201ctragic. But I don\u2019t think it is going to impact a great deal of travel.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are looking at numbers for the summer that are better than they were at this time in 2019.\u201d\nThat bullish assessment may have been reflected in Thursday\u2019s trading session for major airlines like Delta Air Lines DAL, +3.00%, United Airlines UAL, +4.06% and American Airlines AAL, +2.95%. All three opened sharply lower, but trimmed their losses later in the day.\nBenchmarks initially plunged, but made an epic comeback in a day when President Joe Biden announced a new round of sanctions against Russia. The S&P 500 SPX, +2.24%, Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.64% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.51% all bounced back over the last 48 hours, after initially falling on the news of Russia\u2019s invasion."

        "body": " \nI have a problem. My daughter lived with a guy for nine years. During that time, I found out that he took out two credit cards in her name without her permission. Identity theft, right?\u00a0\nMy daughter found out, but her boyfriend said he would pay them off. So she did nothing.\u00a0 When I found out about it, I told her to call the police and have him arrested for identity theft.\u00a0\nEventually, she broke off the relationship. She is now on her own. Now two years later, we found out that the guy fell into a liquor bottle and lost his job, and he is two months behind in payments to the credit-card company.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt this point, is there anything that she can do to protect herself? I know from hearing other people\u2019s stories that the credit-card company will come after her because it\u2019s her name on the cards.\nConcerned Father\n \nTwo years is a long time to allow someone to use credit cards taken out fraudulently in your name. A lot of damage can be done in that time. And a lot more damage can still be done.\nOne of the questions your daughter will be asked if and when she reports this fraud is whether she knew these cards were taken out in her name. If she says yes, they are likely to hold her responsible for the debt incurred on them.\u00a0\nIf her ex-boyfriend could prove she was present when these transactions took place, it would be difficult for her to argue that she was unaware of them and that she did not approve them. In other words, she could be held as complicit.\u00a0\nStill, he forged her name. In New York, a person who does that is guilty of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another. That could come with a prison sentence of up to seven years.\u00a0\n \u201cOne of the questions she will be asked if and when she reports this fraud is whether she knew these cards were taken out in her name. \u201d \nShe should contact her credit-card company today and report the transactions, and have the cards suspended. She should then call the three main credit bureaus \u2014 Experian, TransUnion and Equifax \u2014 and freeze her credit.\nYour daughter should also report the forged credit cards to the Federal Trade Commission. She may or may not wish to file a police report. She faces severe financial \u2014 and, possibly, legal \u2014 consequences if she allows this to continue.\nWhether it\u2019s identity theft or identity fraud, he is using her name and credit to run up bills for his own purposes. If he did it once, he will likely do it again. The best predictor of future behavior, as we all know, is past behavior.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s possible that this is also a form of financial abuse. Indeed, she may be afraid to contact the police. But she will never be free of this potentially manipulative behavior or this man unless she takes decisive action.\u00a0\nThis is your daughter\u2019s problem to fix. You can give her the information and support she needs, but I caution you against paying off her and/or her ex-boyfriend\u2019s credit-card bills.\nYou\u00a0can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com, and follow Quentin Fottrell on\u00a0Twitter.\nCheck out\u00a0the Moneyist private Facebook\u00a0group, where we look for answers to life\u2019s thorniest money issues.

        "body": " \nMy friend\u2019s mom passed away about a year ago. She had a will, but it was null and void because there was only one witness signature. She has two daughters. One of the girls, Mary, moved into her home and started driving her car, etc.\u00a0\nTheir mother had a $32,000 joint checking account with her best friend. The friend signed this account to Kelly, the other daughter. Kelly tried to work with Mary on splitting everything (home, contents, car and money) right down middle after paying all the bills.\u00a0\nMary would not agree on anything because she wants everything. So Kelly spent the money, and now Mary is taking her to court. Mary still lives in their mother\u2019s home, and their mother\u2019s car was repossessed because she could not pay the loan, and she also wrecked it.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe spent a life-insurance check for $10,000 that was supposed to pay for the funeral. And Kelly\u2019s lawyer dropped her when he found out she spent that money. That life insurance and checking account was never supposed to be part of the estate. Do they have a case?\nConcerned Friend\n \nA person\u2019s death should not be an opportunity to reenact an episode of \u201cSupermarket Sweep\u201d where the beneficiaries run through the aisles grabbing whatever they can. The fact that your friend\u2019s mother\u2019s will was null and void does not mean it\u2019s a free-for-all for one or both daughters. They risk displaying not only a lack of decorum, but also a disregard for the letter of the law.\nWhen somebody dies intestate \u2014 without a valid will \u2014 their estate goes through the probate process in accordance with state law. The probate court will take an accounting of all the assets in the estate: real estate, life-insurance policies, bank accounts, furniture and jewelry. These assets will then be distributed to the beneficiaries \u2014 in this case, the two daughters.\nThe life-insurance company will have a named beneficiary: presumably, either one or both of the daughters if the coverage period has not been exceeded and the premiums are current. Those proceeds will be payable to the named beneficiary or beneficiaries upon proof of death \u2014 typically, a death certificate. Then a claim form is submitted to the life-insurance company.\u00a0\nWho inherits the money from their mother\u2019s checking account would depend on the kind of joint account. If your mother was the owner of a joint-tenants-in-common bank account, the balance would be transferred to her estate. If the account was joint tenants with rights of survivorship, the money would go to the co-owner, rather than the next of kin of the deceased.\nWhat you have described is an unholy mess, but more importantly a fundamental misunderstanding of the probate process. The probate court should appoint an administrator to oversee the estate as there is no valid will. The administrator will then determine what remains of their mother\u2019s estate and will distribute the proceeds equally between the heirs.\nYou\u00a0can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com, and follow Quentin Fottrell on\u00a0Twitter.\nCheck out\u00a0the Moneyist private Facebook\u00a0group, where we look for answers to life\u2019s thorniest money issues.

I will retire in nine years with a full government pension, which will be about $100,000 a year, and will have about $1 million in savings.\u00a0\nMy girlfriend makes twice what I make and runs her mom\u2019s company. Her mom has stated in her will that her daughter will inherit her company, money and assets when she dies. That, at a minimum, will be worth a few million dollars.\nWe are going to get married and I want a prenuptial agreement to protect myself, but my girlfriend is against it. \nI fear that even though she will eventually have more assets than me, if her mom puts her business in a trust, I would not be entitled to anything in a divorce and she would be entitled to half of my pension.\nWhat do you think?\nAbout to Say I Do, I Think\n \nIt\u2019s hard to debate the pros and cons of a prenuptial agreement with your girlfriend if you don\u2019t know why she is against it. \nIs it because she thinks you will never get divorced? That logic cuts both ways: If you\u2019re going to live happily ever after, get a prenup; it won\u2019t make the slightest difference. If you see divorce as a realistic possibility, as it is for millions of couples, go ahead and sign one.\u00a0Inheritances are not considered community property. Is it because she thinks you will get divorced? In that case, you have more reason to stay within the prenuptial-agreement comfort zone.\nCommunity-property states allow people to take out of their marriage what they brought into it. That includes your savings, as long as you don\u2019t commingle in a joint account. Outside of those community-property states \u2014 Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin and an opt-in right in Alaska \u2014 assets are divided equitably, but not necessarily equally. The length of the marriage and spouses\u2019 respective incomes play a role.\nAccording to the law firm Cooper Ginsburg Gray, \u201cThe \u2018marital share\u2019 of the pension is determined by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of months during the marriage (between the date of marriage and the date of separation) that the employee was employed and earning service toward the pension. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of months of the employee\u2019s service. The spouse can be awarded up to 50% of the marital share.\u201d\nI received a letter from a reader last year who considered putting his assets in a secret trust prior to his marriage because his fiance\u00e9 similarly refused to sign a prenup. While that would likely keep those assets as separate property if he did that before the marriage, I advised him that doing something so surreptitious was a high-risk strategy, and could jeopardize the trust they have in each other in their relationship. Marriage is a contract. A prenup is a contract.\u00a0\nPrenups outline a blueprint for a possible divorce, but they can also set the expected standards for the marriage itself. People include provisions covering everything from alimony, debt, and incapacity to pets, penalties for infidelity and even what partners can write about each other on social media.\u00a0A prenuptial agreement may seem to contradict the spirit of the marriage contract, but it is a sensible choice when large sums of money are involved.\nYou\u00a0can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com, and follow Quentin Fottrell on\u00a0Twitter.\nCheck out\u00a0the Moneyist private Facebook\u00a0group, where we look for answers to life\u2019s thorniest money issues.

        "body": "Five years can change your life.\nEach of these three investment moves has an amazing lifetime payoff, especially if you (or someone you know) can start in their 20s. Do them all, and you could be set for a very comfortable retirement.\nYou can turn yourself into a multi-millionaire by saving for retirement for just five years. Start at 25, and you will be giving yourself the greatest gift an investor can have: time.\nSure, luck is important. But time is more important.\nTo see why, let\u2019s assume that you\u2019re 25 years old and you\u2019ve decided that when you\u2019re 30, you will start a long-term savings plan for your retirement. Further, we\u2019ll assume that you will retire at age 70 (which in the year 2061 may be the norm.) That\u2019s not a bad plan. But it could be better.\n If you start now, at 25, five years of modest investments can leave you with millions when it\u2019s time to retire, no matter what you do after you\u2019re 30.\nHere\u2019s the setup: You\u2019re 25 and you have a decent job. You don\u2019t have tons of money to spare, but you figure out how to save $500 a month for your long-term future. That adds up to $6,000 a year, which you can put into an IRA, either a Roth (in which you\u2019ll pay taxes on the $6,000 just as if you\u2019ve spent it but get a huge tax break later) or a traditional one (in which you can defer taxes on the $6,000, making it less expensive at the moment).\nDo that for five years and you\u2019ll have invested $30,000.\nDuring this five years, your investments are earning a return, though it\u2019s impossible to know how much.\nIf we assume you receive the very-long-term compound annual growth rate of the S&P 500 index SPX, +2.24% \u2014 10.7% \u2014 your $30,000 would grow to $37,144 when you\u2019re 30.\nGood luck, bad luck\nI mentioned luck, and it certainly applies here.\nIn any of these three cases, your $22,998 or $37,144 or $65,323 seems like only a tiny start toward $4 million. But every penny of it is money you won\u2019t have if you wait until you\u2019re 30.\nNow assume you invest that money (and only that money) for the next 40 years in the S&P 500. Since 1928, the average 40-year compound annual growth rate of the index has been 11%. So let\u2019s assume you achieved that from age 30 to 70.\nRemember that this won\u2019t be a straight line of 11% returns. There will be great years for the stock market, and there will be years where the market goes down and your portfolio shrinks. But we can\u2019t see into the future, so history is the best guide we have.\nGiven these caveats and depending on whether you start (at age 30) with $22,998, $37,144 or $65,323, at age 70 you would have $1.49 million or $2.41 million or $4.25 million.\nThose numbers came from only $30,000 of your own money \u2013 without assuming you invested anything after your 30th birthday. That\u2019s why a long time horizon is so powerful in investing.\n \u201cSure, luck is important. But time is more important.\u201d \nThis plan lets the ups and downs of life get in the way after age 30. But I\u2019m presuming that after five years of savings, you\u2019ll have good habits and will continue contributing to your IRA, leaving you with more money (probably MUCH more) at age 70. \nIn the interest of balancing risks, that future money won\u2019t be all in stocks, meaning not only will you have less time to invest but also will likely have lower returns. So consider this 100% equities investment that you made over just five years the jewel of your retirement portfolio.\nMore: Make your kid rich for $1 a day\nYou\u2019ll improve your results a great deal if instead of putting your money into an IRA, you participate in a 401(k) or similar retirement plan in which your employer offers a 25% match. That will add $1,500 a year to your own savings. (And in a way it\u2019s like free money to you.)\nAgain using the three rates of return we assumed above (unlucky, average, very lucky), this employer match will leave you with an additional $5,750, $9,286, or $16,331 at age 30.\nThose extra amounts, invested for the next 40 years at 11%, would add $373,755, or $603,598 or $1.06 million to what you would have at age 70.\nThat\u2019s the value of choosing a generous employer, so choose carefully.\nAnd remember that the three figures I just reported resulted from only $1,500 a year for those early five years \u2014 $7,500 in total.\nIt\u2019s no secret that over the long term (and 45 years certainly qualifies), other asset classes have outperformed the S&P 500 index.\nU.S. small-cap value stocks RUJ, +2.47% hold the best record for beating the S&P 500. From 1970 through 2020, they achieved a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%.\nFor the five years of investments that we\u2019re discussing, you can easily put that information to work for you. I suggest a 50/50 combination of the S&P 500 and small-cap value stocks. Over the 51-year period 1970 through 2020, that combination would have grown at an annual rate of 12.3%.\nApplied to your own savings and your employer match, that asset combination would give you $65,285 by the time you\u2019re 30.\nAnd if you invested that amount at the S&P 500\u2019s long-term rate of 11% for another 40 years, you\u2019d wind up with $4.24 million at age 70.\nBut just for fun, let\u2019s imagine that after five years, you are comfortable with this 50/50 combination of the S&P and small-cap value \u2013 and you continue it for the next 40 years. At the long-term growth rate of 12.3%, your $65,285 would become $6.75 million.\nDig deeper: Why this fund combination is better than the S&P 500\nI\u2019ve just shown you three pretty simple steps to turn five years of $500-a-month savings into a multi-million-dollar nest egg.\nBut some people will criticize these numbers as very unrealistic. And that criticism is deserved. The reason: What I\u2019m showing you is based on the assumption that you don\u2019t save another dime for retirement after age 30.\nIn fact, it\u2019s much more likely that you will continue saving, thus taking more advantage of that great gift of time. \u00a0\nAs part of a smart investment strategy, you also should reduce your risk by putting other money into bonds. Talk to the financial firm handling your IRA or 401(k) or other financial pro about the right asset allocation for you.\nRead: Is the a portfolio of 60% and 40% bonds really dead?\nPlus: When is it worth hiring someone to manage your money?\nJust for kicks, I wondered what the result would be if after age 30 you kept investing only half as much: $250 a month or $3,000 a year, with zero employer match, in the 50/50 combination of the S&P 500 and small-cap value stocks. \nThe result: $11.96 million at age 70.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking.

A 529 plan is one smart way to save, invest and pay for those expenses in a tax-advantageous way.\u00a0\nThis is what you need to know \u2014 and the pitfalls to avoid.\nThere are two major types of 529 plans, both of which are offered by state governments: a prepaid plan, where the investor picks a specific school before funding the account (and the money can only be used for that school later on), and an education savings plan, where money is invested immediately and there are few limits on what school is eventually chosen.\u00a0\nPrepaid plans can sound like a great idea if you\u2019re worried about ever-rising tuition bills. But fewer and fewer states still offer them, and the plans that survive are very restrictive. Admission to that school isn\u2019t guaranteed, of course, and if a student opts to study elsewhere, the person who set up the plan can lose money. Any earnings that are distributed for non-qualified reasons, like those not put toward tuition, are taxed and incur a 10% penalty.\nYes, account holders can roll a prepaid 529 plan into a regular 529 account, in which case the contributions and earnings would move over. But there might be a penalty or administrative fees for this transaction; it depends on the prepaid plan\u2019s contract.\u00a0\nKeep in mind though: Only nine states offer prepaid 529 plans as of now, and the beneficiary is restricted to using the money for tuition at an in-state college. Basically, read the fine print.\u00a0\nFlorida is one state that still offers prepaid plans. It has five plans, each with different payment options. A parent whose child was born in January 2021 can fund a four-year university plan, the most expensive option, for $185 a month. A parent whose child was born in January 2011 and is now in fifth grade could pay into the same prepaid plan for a four-year university, and the cost would be $327 a month.\u00a0\nBut beware: these plans don\u2019t automatically cover room and board. The University of Florida, for example, estimates that incoming freshmen in the 2021-2022 academic year will spend $5,800 on housing and $4,600 on food \u2014 far more combined than the $6,380 charged for in-state tuition. Books and supplies, also not covered by the prepaid plan, are estimated at another $810. \nIf that Florida parent wants to prepay dorm costs, though, that\u2019s an option. The parent of the infant would pay $50 more a month, while the fifth grader\u2019s parent would pay an additional $89 per month.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor most people, the default option is the educational savings plan. Anyone can set up an account to help a future student cover education costs in any state, so you don\u2019t have to open a 529 plan in Connecticut if you\u2019re hoping your child or grandchild goes to Yale University or in California if you\u2019re expecting admission from UCLA. But the tax benefits vary depending on where the account owner, not the eventual student, lives.\u00a0\nUnlike with a prepaid plan, this money can be used to cover room and board as well as tuition.\u00a0\nBecause these plans are offered by state governments, rules surrounding any tax breaks vary. For example, in some states, taxpayers can deduct 529 plan contributions when filing state income taxes \u2014 or even get a tax credit. But there may be limitations, such as using the state\u2019s 529 plan or a cap on what\u2019s deductible. There are no tax deductions on the federal level.\u00a0\nRegardless of the 529 plan you pick, the money grows tax-free. Plans offer a variety of investment options, generally different combinations of stocks and bonds, allowing the account owner to decide just how much risk to take on. The earlier you start, the more you can let time do some of the heavy lifting to increase the value of the account, a concept known as compounding.\nRead: College net-price calculators can be wildly off \u2014 these 3 simple changes would make them more accurate\nYou can now use the money to pay for registered apprenticeship programs.\nIn addition to college, up to $10,000 per year can be spent at qualifying elementary and secondary schools, regardless of whether the school is public, private or religious.\u00a0\nFinally, if the account beneficiary decides not to go to college or doesn\u2019t use all of the assets in the account, the account owner can pick another beneficiary (even themselves) at no penalty. Up to $10,000 can be used for student-loan repayments, but that\u2019s a lifetime limit.\nAbout half of states allow deductions for rollovers into their plans, according to the site Saving For College. There may be state taxes or penalty fees tacked on to rollovers, so do your due diligence before attempting this move.\nBut you might not want to consolidate 529 plans even if you do have the opportunity.\nBeneficiaries are allowed to have multiple 529 plans in a state, but the account balances are added cumulatively and cannot exceed a state\u2019s maximum balance limit (in most cases, between $300,000 and $500,000, according to Merrill). Have accounts in different states, however, and that rule doesn\u2019t apply.\u00a0\nFor example, a child\u2019s mother and grandfather open separate 529 plans for the child in New York. Together, the balance must not be more than $520,000. If the two adults lived and opened these accounts in different states \u2013 say, one in New York and one in Pennsylvania \u2013 they could surpass New York\u2019s $520,000 limit. Here are the aggregate limits across the U.S.\u00a0\nRead: Many parents are feeling the pain of borrowing for their kids\u2019 college\nPlus: New student-loan forgiveness guidelines explained: a step-by-step guide to taking advantage of the PSLF waiver\nWhen opening an account, applicants may be asked to name a \u201csuccessor owner.\u201d That person will become the new owner of the account following the death of the current owner. This decision is critical \u2014 the right owner will manage the plan, including the responsibilities of funding it, checking on its investments periodically and withdrawing from the account appropriately. This decision also helps when settling the original owner\u2019s estate.\u00a0\nSome plans may have rules for determining the next owner, while in other scenarios, the plan may have to go through probate, opening the family up to potential legal battles and extra fees.\u00a0\nYes.\u00a0\nIn some cases, giving money to a child\u2019s 529 plan is as easy as sharing a link online. Ugift, which works with financial institution Ascensus, is an online service that allows families and friends to transfer money directly to an individual\u2019s 529 plan without any fees, so that they can gift a 529 contribution for birthdays, holidays or just because. The gifter could also be eligible for a state tax break, depending on that state\u2019s rules.\u00a0\nGoing beyond any tax breaks, individuals \u2014 the parent, grandparent or someone else \u2014 can contribute $15,000 annually without triggering the need to file a gift tax return, or $75,000 if they choose to \u201csuperfund\u201d it, meaning they made five years\u2019 worth of contributions up front. This approach can be used in estate planning and reducing eventual estate taxes.\nShould I use a 401(k) or an IRA to save for retirement? A traditional account or the Roth version?

        "body": "Most Americans live in places where healthy people, including students in schools, can safely take a break from wearing masks under new U.S. guidelines released Friday.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0outlined\u00a0the new set of measures for communities where COVID-19 is easing its grip, with less of a focus on positive test results and more on what\u2019s happening at hospitals.\nThe new system greatly changes the look of the CDC\u2019s risk map and puts more than 70% of the U.S. population in counties where the coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals. Those are the people who can stop wearing masks, the agency said.\nThe agency is still advising that people, including schoolchildren, wear masks where the risk of COVID-19 is high. That\u2019s the situation in about 37% of U.S. counties, where about 28% of Americans reside.\nThe new recommendations do not change the requirement to wear masks on public transportation and indoors in airports, train stations and bus stations. The CDC guidelines for other indoor spaces aren\u2019t binding, meaning cities and institutions even in areas of low risk may set their own rules. And the agency says people with COVID-19 symptoms or who test positive shouldn\u2019t stop wearing masks.\nBut with\u00a0protection from immunity\u00a0rising \u2014 both from vaccination and infection \u2014 the overall risk of severe disease is now generally lower, the CDC said.\n\u201cAnybody is certainly welcome to wear a mask at any time if they feel safer wearing a mask,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a news briefing. \u201cWe want to make sure our hospitals are OK and people are not coming in with severe disease. \u2026 Anyone can go to the CDC website, find out the volume of disease in their community and make that decision.\u201d\nSince July, CDC\u2019s transmission-prevention guidance to communities has focused on two measures \u2014 the rate of new COVID-19 cases and the percentage of positive test results over the previous week.\nBased on those measures, agency officials advised people to wear masks indoors in counties where the spread of the virus was deemed substantial or high. This week, more than 3,000 of the nation\u2019s more than 3,200 counties \u2014 greater than 95% \u2014 were listed as having substantial or high transmission.\nThat guidance has increasingly been ignored, however, with states, cities, counties and school districts across the U.S. announcing plans to drop mask mandates amid declining COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\nWith many Americans already taking off their masks, the CDC\u2019s shift won\u2019t make much practical difference for now, said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine. But it will help when the next wave of infection \u2014 a likelihood in the fall or winter \u2014 starts threatening hospital capacity again, he said.\n\u201cThere will be more waves of COVID. And so I think it makes sense to give people a break from masking,\u201d Noymer said. \u201cIf we have continual masking orders, they might become a total joke by the time we really need them again.\u201d\nThe CDC is also offering a color-coded map \u2014 with counties designated as orange, yellow or green \u2014 to help guide local officials and residents. In green counties, local officials can drop any indoor masking rules. Yellow means people at high risk for severe disease should be cautious. Orange designates places where the CDC suggests masking should be universal.\nHow a county comes to be designated green, yellow or orange will depend on its rate of new COVID-19 hospital admissions, the share of staffed hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients and the rate of new cases in the community.\nMask requirements already have ended in most of the U.S. in recent weeks. Los Angeles on Friday began allowing people to remove their masks while indoors if they are vaccinated, and indoor mask mandates in Washington state and Oregon will be lifted in March.\nIn a sign of the political divisions over masks, Florida\u2019s governor on Thursday announced new recommendations called \u201cBuck the CDC\u201d that actually discourage mask wearing.\nState health officials are generally pleased with the new guidance and \u201cexcited with how this is being rolled out,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\u201cThis is the way we need to go. I think this is taking us forward with a new direction going on in the pandemic,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still focusing on safety. We\u2019re still focusing on preventing death and illness.\u201d\nThe CDC said the new system will be useful in predicting future surges and urged communities with wastewater surveillance systems to use that data too.\n\u201cIf or when new variants emerge or the virus surges, we have more ways to protect ourselves and our communities than ever before,\u201d Walensky said."

Early hopes of herd immunity against the coronavirus faded for several reasons.\nOne is that antibodies developed from available vaccines or previous infection dwindle with time. While vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness, waning antibodies mean it\u2019s still possible to get infected \u2014 even for those who are boosted.\nThen there\u2019s the huge variation in vaccinations. In some low-income countries, less than 5% of the population is vaccinated. Rich countries are struggling with vaccine hesitancy. And young children still aren\u2019t eligible in many places.\nAs long as the virus spreads, it mutates \u2014 helping the virus survive and giving rise to new variants. Those mutants \u2014 such as omicron \u2014 can become better at evading the protection people have from vaccines or an earlier infection.\nPopulations are moving toward \u201cherd resistance,\u201d where infections will continue, but people have enough protection that future spikes won\u2019t be as disruptive to society, Milton says.\nMany scientists believe COVID-19 will eventually become like the flu and cause seasonal outbreaks but not huge surges."

        "body": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Scientists warned the British government on Monday not to weaken the country\u2019s ability to monitor and track coronavirus after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ends the requirement for people in England to self-isolate if they contract COVID-19.\nThe legal requirement to self-isolate for at least five days after a positive coronavirus test is expected to be replaced by guidance, and mass testing for the virus will be scaled back.\nThe new plan foresees vaccines and treatments keeping the virus in check as it becomes endemic in the country. Everyone 75 and older will be offered a fourth vaccine dose, along with those 12 and up who have conditions that make them vulnerable to severe disease.\nJohnson urged people not to \u201cthrow caution to the winds,\u201d but said it was time to move \u201caway from banning certain courses of action, compelling certain courses of action, in favor of encouraging personal responsibility.\u201d\nSome scientists, however, said it was a risky move that could bring a surge in infections and weaken the country\u2019s defenses against more virulent future strains.Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, said \u201cthe decision about when and how to reduce restrictions is enormously difficult.\u201d\nHe said it was essential to maintain \u201csurveillance for the virus, an early warning system if you like, which tells us about new variants emerging and gives an ability to monitor whether those new variants are indeed causing more severe disease than omicron did.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative government lifted most virus restrictions in January, scrapping vaccine passports for venues and ending mask mandates in most settings apart from hospitals in England.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which set their own public health rules, also have opened up, although more slowly.\nMonday\u2019s announcement applies only to England, which is home to 56 million of the U.K.\u2019s 67 million people.\nA combination of high vaccination rates in the U.K. and the milder omicron variant meant that easing restrictions didn\u2019t lead to a surge in hospitalizations and deaths. Both are falling, though the U.K. still has Europe\u2019s highest coronavirus toll after Russia, with more than 160,000 recorded deaths.\nIn Britain, 85% of people age 12 and up have had two vaccine doses and almost two-thirds have had a third booster shot.\nThe announcement will please many Conservative Party lawmakers, who argue that the restrictions were inefficient and disproportionate. It could also shore up Johnson\u2019s position among party lawmakers, who have been mulling an attempt to oust him over scandals including lockdown-breaching government parties during the pandemic.\nHealth psychologist Robert West, a member of a government advisory committee, said the Conservative government looked set to \u201cabdicate its own responsibility for looking after its population.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks as though what the government has said is that it accepts that the country is going to have to live with somewhere between 20,000 and 80,000 COVID deaths a year and isn\u2019t really going to do anything about it,\u201d he said, speaking in a personal capacity. \u201cNow that seems to me to be irresponsible.\u201d\nA reminder that the virus remains widespread came Sunday with the news that Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19. Buckingham Palace said the 95-year-old monarch was experiencing mild, cold-like symptoms, was continuing with light duties and would follow all government regulations."

Then, the student loan company somehow changed the student loan to make my mother the primary owner of this debt, and my sister isn\u2019t even on the student loan anymore.\u00a0\nMy father passed away a couple of years ago and my mother received money from his life insurance, but it wasn\u2019t much. It saddens me that the only income left for her is being taken by a student loan company. Is there any advice I can give her to offer a glimmer of hope? I emailed a lawyer who said there\u2019s not much that can be done as she was the cosigner and is as responsible for it.

Email chill@marketwatch.com. \nAnswer: Unfortunately, if your mother agreed to be a cosigner on the original loan, she agreed to legally repay it in the event that her daughter could not.\u00a0 \u201cIf cosigners have difficulty meeting their student debt bill each month, they have only the options available from the private lender,\u201d says Anna Helhoski, student loan expert at NerdWallet. That said, \u201csome private lenders promise to discharge the debt if the primary borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled,\u201d explains Andrew Pentis, certified student loans counselor and higher education finance expert at Student Loan Hero. But other private lenders may only do it, for example, if the primary borrower passes away.\u00a0\nSo what should your mom do now?\u00a0 If she can\u2019t make payments, pros say you should contact your student lender about negotiating new payment terms or temporarily lowering payments. \u201cOtherwise, the only other options might be to try to settle the debt with the lender or pursue private student loan discharge via bankruptcy, which can be challenging and expensive,\u201d says Helhoski.\nBut don\u2019t despair, as this doesn\u2019t mean your mother is without options. \u201cIf she\u2019s on a limited income, it could be wise for her to set up a debt management plan with a nonprofit credit counseling agency. This way, she and her credit counselor could set up a three-to-five-year payoff of the loan, perhaps at a reduced interest rate and her counselor could mediate,\u201d says Pentis. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA) both offer nationwide resources for nonprofit credit counseling.\nEven before committing to such a plan, your mom can likely get a free consultation from a nonprofit agency that\u2019s accredited by the NFCC.\u00a0 For example, \u201cat GreenPath [a financial wellness nonprofit], you can chat with a student loan counselor about all of your options and develop a customized plan, all without opening your wallet. If a more drastic strategy like filing for bankruptcy as a means of discharging the debt is needed, the counselor can offer a recommendation,\u201d says Pentis.\nAnother option, if your mother is able to get a cosigner on the loan (she may need one), would be to refinance the loan at a lower rate with another private lender. \u201cShe could extend the loan term to keep her monthly payments low, though that would increase the overall cost of the loan due to accruing interest. The eligibility criteria of refinancing are quite stiff, so your mother or the cosigner would need strong credit to make up for limited cash flow,\u201d says Pentis."

What can I do?\nHave a question about getting out of student loan or other debt? Email chill@marketwatch.com.\u00a0\nAnswer: The good news is that if you have federal student loans, you have a couple options. While your federal loan payments are likely on pause through May 1, 2022, when you have to begin repaying them, you\u2019re going to want to make the payments manageable. So pros recommend considering an income-driven repayment plan. \u201cIf your discretionary income is determined to be $0, your monthly payment could be set as low as $0,\u201d says Rebecca Safier, certified student loan counselor and higher education finance expert at Student Loan Hero.\u00a0 (Note that if you do have federal loans, refinancing is likely not a good option because it will strip the loans of federal protections like income-driven repayment options.)\nNot sure which income-based plan to choose? \u201cYou can read over different income-driven plans to see which option would be best for you, or you can simply ask your loan servicer to pick the one with the lowest monthly payment,\u201d says Safir.Another option is to request deferment or forbearance once the federal student loan payment pause is up. Both programs allow you to pause your loan payments temporarily due to financial hardship or other qualifying reasons, but note that in most cases interest will accrue on your loans. (Read more about deferment and forbearance here.) While an income-driven repayment plan is preferable, opting for deferment or forbearance won\u2019t negatively impact your credit score. But pros say it\u2019s not a long-term solution and the accrual of interest can be burdensome.\nPrivate student loans, unfortunately, aren\u2019t eligible for these federal programs, but your loan servicer might be able to work with you to adjust your payments or even pause them temporarily. \u201cIt\u2019s worth calling your servicer to discuss your situation and see if they can help. You might also explore refinancing your private student loans, which could lead to a better interest rate and new monthly terms,\u201d says Safier. (See the best student loan refinancing rates you can qualify for here.)\nOne thing to consider is that if you select a longer term, your monthly payments might go down, but you will pay more in interest. \u201cIf you don\u2019t currently have an income, though, you would likely need to apply with a cosigner to qualify,\u201d says Safier."

        "body": "The national average interest rate for savings accounts is a lowly 0.06%, according to Bankrate\u2019s weekly survey of institutions. That\u2019s a number so low you may be wondering if utilizing a traditional savings account is even worth it. The simple answer is probably, pros say, but only for some things (and make sure you get a high-yield savings account if you do); for most things, there are other options worth considering that will yield more growth.\nExperts say that one big thing that might make sense for you to put into a high-interest savings account is your emergency fund (6-9 months worth of expenses) \u2014 simply because it needs to be safe and easily accessible at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cEmergency savings or funds that you\u2019ll need in the short term should be placed in an account that is easily accessible without penalties or tax consequences. Since the primary goal is accessibility and safety of principal, it\u2019s okay to trade a low interest rate for that,\u201d certified financial planner Luis F. Rosa recently told MarketWatch Picks.\u00a0 Another time when it might make sense to use a savings account is if you have a big goal \u2014 like, say, buying a home or taking a nice vacation \u2014 that you want to do in less than a year.\u00a0\nJust don\u2019t opt for an account paying 0.06%. \u201cOnline savings accounts offered by federally-insured banks and credit unions offer the ultimate safety, while providing access to the money without penalty when it\u2019s needed. They consistently pay better yields than the savings accounts at most banks and other cash investments such as money funds,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. Adds Chanelle Bessette, banking specialist at NerdWallet: Consumers should search for terms like \u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201chigh interest\u201d when researching new savings accounts to make sure they\u2019re getting the best available rate, says.\nAs of February 22, LendingClub is offering interest of 0.65% with a $2,500 minimum balance, Marcus by Goldman Sachs is offering 0.50% with no minimum balance, Alliant\u2019s current APY is 0.55% with $5 minimum, and Comenity Direct\u2019s APY is 0.60% with a $100 minimum balance, to name a few.\u00a0\nMcBride advises that you look for a savings account that has a low minimum initial deposit and no ongoing balance requirement, plenty of which he says are available with competitive yields, including Synchrony at 0.50% and no minimum balance and American Express National Bank with 0.50% and no minimum balance. Just beware of fees and other fine print to find the best savings account for you.\nAs for your other mid-to-longer term goals, you may be better off with other avenues. CDs or conservative bond funds might be an option for goals happening relatively soon, says Cory Phillips, CRPC and financial adviser at Fort Pitt Capital Group: \u201cYou can likely beat the rate your bank savings is offering,\u201d says Phillips. And for long-term goals like retirement, investing is the way to go.\u00a0 \u201cIn longer spans of time, the market has some predictability, but in the short-term it can be the great unknown,\u201d says Phillips."

        "body": "Question: I\u2019m 66 years old and retired and have $70,000 in student loan debt. I\u2019m currently on an income-driven repayment plan but my loans are being moved to a different loan servicing agency. My loan payments have been $0 a month because my Social Security is too low to warrant payments. Is there a way to have this debt canceled? I don\u2019t expect l will live long enough to repay these loans.\nHave a question about getting out of student loan or other debt? Email chill@marketwatch.com.\nAnswer:\u00a0 This query \u201ccuts to the heart\u201d of why senior citizens are asking the Biden administration \u201cWhat about us?\u201d regarding student loan relief, says Andrew Pentis, loans expert and certified student loan counselor at StudentLoanHero. The administration has \u201cbeen really great about targeted student loan forgiveness programs\u201d for groups such as veterans and disabled individuals, he adds, but for older borrowers, not so much. That said, pros have some suggestions for you. \nIn your specific case, student loan experts agree on a number of fronts about this situation: a) There\u2019s no magic bullet to cancel the debt; b) awareness of the recent reshuffling of loan servicers exiting and entering the industry is laudable \u2013 some borrowers aren\u2019t as on top of things; and c) staying on the current course of income-based repayment is a good plan based on the facts you\u2019ve provided.\nWhile your debt-to-income ratio may put the kibosh on securing additional credit, the upside is that you are on an income-driven repayment plan to keep the monthly bill low. There are four income driven repayment plans, and they\u2019re designed to maintain affordable monthly payments relative to income.\u00a0\nAs payments are made \u2013 in your case, $0, but it could be another amount in other situations \u2013 for 20 or 25 years, depending on which of the four IDR plans you are enrolled in, the leftover balance will be forgiven.\u00a0\nIncome in your case is unlikely to change since the source is your\u00a0Social Security benefit, and monthly payments should also remain static. As long as you keep making the $0 monthly payment your credit score should only go up, pros say. The loan is going to remain current, and you don\u2019t have to worry about missing a payment and the negative consequences of delinquency.\u00a0\nThere is a possible caveat. There has historically been income tax imposed on forgiven student loan debt, but Congress recently made forgiveness tax-free through 2025 on the federal level. Assuming that\u2019s not extended and you receive relief for the loan after that date, you could have a large tax bill on your hands.\u00a0\nNote though, that programs change \u2013 and change again. \u201cThere is always a possibility that loan forgiveness might no longer be considered taxable income under income driven repayment,\u201d\u00a0 says Anna Helhoski, student loan expert at NerdWallet. Given your limited income, you could likely enter into some kind of repayment agreement with the IRS.It\u2019s also important to note that, according to Leslie Tayne, founder and managing director of Tayne Law Group, bankruptcy is likely not a choice here because it doesn\u2019t appear that a physical disability is making work impossible.\nAs you maintain your current repayment strategy, consider these housekeeping chores. Contact your new federal loan servicer to confirm that your account is in order and that \u201cthere\u2019s been no hiccups in the transfer,\u201d says Pentis. Ensure that you\u2019re still qualifying for your IDR plan and are up to date, and check to be sure you\u2019re being credited for your $0 payments (annualcreditreport.com) since mistakes happen.\u00a0\nRegarding your final point of your life expectancy: Fiscal sages are in sync about mortality and liability. If you\u2019re the primary borrower of a federal student loan and you pass away, then the debt would be discharged."

        "title": "Opinion: Inheritance, estate planning and charitable giving: 4 strategies to reduce taxes now",
        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "2022-02-18 14:05:00",
        "author": "\nBy\n\nAnn Marie Etergino\n\n",
        "body": "Working in the Washington, D.C., area, no matter who\u2019s in the White House, I\u2019m often thrust into conversations about tax policy. My clients tend to be more aware of various political issues and they\u2019re particularly interested in tax law changes and how those changes affect wealth.\nHistorically those conversations have been more academic and almost theoretical. But in recent years, they\u2019ve really changed as we\u2019ve seen a psychological shift in how clients think about taxes, charitable giving, estate planning and inheritance. Once more hesitant to plan ahead, clients in today\u2019s environment are much more proactive and willing to take action in the near term rather than waiting and risking having to pay higher taxes down the line.\nTake, for example, recent Build Back Better bill conversations. With their negotiations and uncertainty, an overwhelming number of clients are proactively asking us to help plan for the financial impacts that tax changes could bring. These tax-sensitive investment strategies discussed with clients are worthwhile no matter when and if changes take effect.\nHere are four strategies we discuss with clients:\nOffsetting capital gains\nCapital gains affect almost everyone with assets. Simply put, capital gains are the profit you make from selling an asset that has appreciated in value since you first acquired it. Not surprisingly, those gains are taxed \u2013 though at lower rates than ordinary income if the asset is held for more than a year. Conversely, losses you incur on your assets can help reduce tax liability. This is one area where we advise clients to strategically harvest tax losses to offset gains.\nIt\u2019s common to see clients sell one stock that has depreciated simultaneously along with another stock that\u2019s worth more than what they paid for it because the loss on one would reduce tax liability on the other. Clients often do this exercise at the end of each year, but today, recognizing that tax on capital gains may increase, an increasing number of clients are proactively employing this strategy throughout the year. This allows them to take advantage of market volatility during times of decline.\nEvaluating Roth conversions\nMany clients used to assume that when they retire, they\u2019ll be in a lower tax bracket, thus giving them an advantage when they start making withdrawals from their retirement accounts. But wealthy clients have Social Security benefits, and sometimes a pension or other retirement income sources, they may also be generating income from their portfolio by way of dividends and interest payments. Combined, these sources of income in retirement often match their earnings during their working years, which means they may not end up in a lower tax bracket after all. These higher-than-expected tax rates could cut into what they have budgeted for retirement and can be a startling realization for clients.\nThis is part of why Roth IRA conversions are an increasingly popular option. Taxes are still required to be paid, but the difference between this vehicle and a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA is\u00a0when\u00a0clients pay taxes. With Roth IRA conversions, you owe taxes on the amount you convert and then that converted amount is able to continue growing tax-free. Plus you do not pay taxes at the time of withdrawals. While the tax hit can be tough to swallow on the front end, we\u2019ve seen many clients take this approach to help protect a long-term investment from being heavily taxed down the road.\nTake this example: A client of mine in her 50s has $1 million in a traditional IRA. She opted to convert it to a Roth IRA. Doing so required her to write a check for $500,000 to pay the taxes on these funds on the front end instead of when she takes a distribution or when her beneficiaries inherit the account.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a Roth IRA must be open for five years and the individual must be at least 59-1/2 years old. But our client decided she would rather pay the taxes now and know that she has a completely tax-free asset that she can either lean on during retirement, or pass down to her heirs.\nMaximizing charitable giving\nCharitable giving as a tax strategy has become a more prominent conversation as well. Historically, clients would fulfill their charitable wishes by just writing a check to the organization of their choice. Today, however, there are many ways clients can be charitable and utilize new tools for tax exemptions.\nA donor-advised fund, or DAF, is one of those popular tools. Donor Advised Funds are third-party funds that are created for the purposes of giving to charity. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in a higher income earning year because you inherited money or sold a business, therefore triggering additional income tax. If you contribute funds to a donor-advised fund, you get a tax break because that contribution gives you a full tax deduction regardless of whether any of the funds have been distributed to charity that year. And if you\u2019re planning to retire soon, this helps you continue to give at preretirement levels even though you won\u2019t have the same steady income. Donor Advised Funds also have the benefit of involving family in giving and passing stewardship values on to multiple generations.\nThe other tool that clients have been utilizing for charitable giving is Required Minimum Distributions (RMD). Your required minimum distribution is the minimum amount you must withdraw from your Traditional IRA each year. Those withdrawals are included in your taxable income \u2014 unless you donate those funds. Like donor-advised funds, giving your RMD amount to charity helps you fulfill your charitable wishes and reduces your tax bill.\n\u2018Giving while living\u2019 to family and friends\nGiving while living is another strategy rising in popularity and feasibility among clients and we expect it to continue to do so as one of the proposals last year was a reduction in how much wealth you can pass down, tax-free.\nWith our wealth planning tools, we\u2019re able to illustrate income, tax liability and estimated amounts after a client has passed away, then we can discuss strategies we can implement today to help minimize estate taxes. As a result, our clients are now deciding to make gift contributions to their family members while they themselves are still living. Under current laws, a person can give up to $16,000 to any other individual annually, whether that\u2019s a child, grandchild, nephew or friend. This money is then moved out of the client\u2019s estate, therefore not taxed, and the recipient receives the full amount of the gift.\nThe notion of giving during a person\u2019s lifetime has become popular not simply because of tax benefits, but because clients want to reap the rewards of seeing the impact their gift can have on loved ones. I recently received an email from a client who told me he gave $15,000 to his daughter as a Hanukkah gift. She loves music and ended up using it for music lessons. It was so moving to see him experience the joy of watching his daughter benefit from that money for months or even years to come.\nThese four tax strategies are among the ways our team has been managing assets for clients. We don\u2019t just trade stocks, we also focus on client priorities, plans for their families, their goals and their desire to contribute to charity.\nAnn Marie Etergino is managing director \u2013 financial advisor, RBC Wealth Management.\nRBC Wealth Management does not provide tax or legal advice.

        "body": "Over the course of my career, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with multiple self-made millionaires. Though they come from varied backgrounds, these investors have a few key habits in common\u2014ones that you can replicate to build wealth to retire comfortably and hit your long-term financial goals.\nMy wealthiest clients pay themselves first by systematically putting money into savings with no intention of using it for day-to-day living. They\u2019re also experts at reverse budgeting: living lifestyles that are affordable after both long- and short-term savings are in place. But what can you do, aside from the obvious saving, to secure wealth in retirement?\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at some of the strategies deployed by my millionaire clients that can help anyone improve their financial wellness in 2022.\n1. Create an organized investment plan\nWhether it\u2019s in stocks, bonds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), my wealthiest clients are diligent and organized about investing.\nSetting up a monthly or bimonthly automatic transfer of cash from your checking account into an investment account ensures you\u2019ll automatically invest\u2014and learn to live on your post-investment funds. By employing this strategy, my clients find they don\u2019t actually miss having that money in their cash flow, but it\u2019ll be there waiting for them when they need to make a big purchase, travel, or retire.\nBe calculated about your investments: how much risk are you willing to take on, and in what time frame do you need access to your money? My younger clients can take on a little more risk in exchange for significant yields. My older clients often feel more reluctant to take on risk, as they need access to their retirement funds sooner.\nHaving a solid grasp on their current financial situation, and their future needs, is a hallmark of my millionaire clients. And as a rule of thumb, they aim to save roughly 20% of their monthly income for savings, emergency funds, retirement and investments.\n2. Take advantage of all employer benefits\nMillionaires don\u2019t leave money on the table. My wealthiest clients know to take full advantage of employer-offered benefits\u2014and you should, too.\n3. Know your options for tax deductions\nMy wealthiest clients are always aware of what taxes they pay and how to minimize them. This often includes searching for elements of tax savings in everything from retirement plan investments, to home mortgage interest, to charitable contributions, to college funding and health savings accounts.\nTo find as many opportunities for tax savings as possible, it\u2019s helpful to consult a financial and tax professional who\u2019s up-to-date on laws and policies.\n4. Don\u2019t forget about the short-term\nTo plan like a millionaire, make sure even your short-term money is working for you. This means maintaining six to nine months of expenses in savings that are both liquid and safe\u2014not at risk to significant market movements.\nThis reserve fund can be a fairly large amount, and in today\u2019s low-interest-rate environment, it can be challenging to find a reasonable return for these \u201copportunity/emergency funds\u201d in traditional savings accounts. Because of this, I recommend a tiered strategy:\u00a0\nIn addition to their disciplined saving and investing, my millionaire clients have one final thing in common: they grow and maintain their wealth by participating in comprehensive financial planning analysis on a regular basis.\nFaron Daugs, CFP, is founder and chief executive of Harrison Wallace Financial Group."

        "body": "There\u2019s something comforting about Warren Buffett having had a very good year.\nIt means that the old rules haven\u2019t been completely upended. Timeless truths that had been dismissed as being hopelessly old-fashioned\u2014such as slow and steady win the race\u2014are discovered to still contain wisdom after all.\nA year ago, you may recall, many were ready to declare that those rules and truths no longer applied, and that Buffett was a has-been. His company Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +3.73% BRK.B, +3.56% was behind the S&P 500 SPX, +2.24% for performance over not just the trailing year but the trailing 10- and 15-year periods as well. One famous day trader declared that Buffett was all \u201cwashed up.\u201d\nHe is probably getting the last laugh now. For performance over the last 12 months, Berkshire Hathaway is more than 15 percentage points ahead of the S&P 500. This is enough to put him ahead of the market for trailing 10- and 15-year returns as well, as you can see from the accompanying chart.\nIf that\u2019s evidence of being \u201cwashed up,\u201d please let me be washed, up too.\nThe occasion for these reflections is the imminent publication of Warren Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, one of the most widely read on Wall Street. Past years\u2019 letters typically have been published when Berkshire Hathaway reports its calendar-year earnings, and this year that\u2019s scheduled for Feb. 26. In response to my inquiry, the company declined to say when this year\u2019s letter would be released.\nThere\u2019s no way of knowing whether Buffett will address his company\u2019s emerging from its long drought of market-lagging performance, or draw any investment lessons from the experience. But the lesson I think is most important is that performance over shorter-term periods\u2014including as long as several years\u2014is largely a matter of luck, and that we therefore shouldn\u2019t be making any investment decisions based on it.\nThis lesson is difficult for us to take to heart, because our investment horizon is a lot shorter from a psychological point of view than it is from a statistical perspective. Take a five-year holding period, for example. Most of us would have serious difficulty sitting on our hands with a strategy that lost money over that many years, and yet it\u2019s entirely possible that a strategy that beats the market over the long term will\u2014due to bad luck alone\u2014lag over a five-year period.\nTo show this, I conducted the following Monte Carlo simulation: What if, in each of the next five calendar years, Buffett\u2019s alpha (return relative to the S&P 500) would be picked at random from his actual alphas over the last 57 years? And what if I reran this experiment 10,000 times?\nIn 15% of these simulations, it turned out, Buffett\u2019s hypothetical five-year return was negative.\nTo be sure, the odds of a negative alpha go down the longer the holding period. But you have to wait a lot longer before the odds of underperforming the market fall below 5%, the threshold often used to determine if something is statistically significant. In my Monte Carlo simulations, this required holding period was 13 years, believe it or not.\nThis is why, a year ago, I wrote that Buffett\u2019s lengthy period of lagging the market was likely caused largely by just bad luck\u2014and that we should give him \u201cthe benefit of the doubt.\u201d So it\u2019s not Monday-morning quarterbacking for me to now say we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that he\u2019s had such a good year.\nThe broader investment lesson: If we want to base our investment decisions on rigorous statistics rather than how we feel, we need to be focusing on performance over periods of many years.\nAnything shorter is probably just noise.\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

        "body": "When it comes to rental rates, it\u2019s definitely not 2020 anymore.\nThe cost to rent a home is rising at the fastest clip in years, as landlords bounce back from their struggles earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. For some households, the surge in rent prices will put homeownership even further out of reach.\nThe overall median rent nationwide as of January was $1,789 per month, according to a new report from Realtor.com. That represents a 19.8% increase over the previous year. January was the eighth consecutive month in which rents rose on an annual basis by more than 10%.\nAnd compared with the price of a two-bedroom home, rental appreciation exceeded home-price growth across every size of rental unit. The median rents for studio apartments rose 21%, while the cost to lease a one- or two-bedroom rental units rose 19.2%. Comparatively, the price to buy a two-bedroom home only increased 11% over the past year.\n\u201cU.S. rental markets are more than making up for lost time, with January data showing national rents continued to surge by double-digits over last year \u2014 and at a faster pace than for-sale home prices,\u201d Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said in the report. \u201cSo much faster, in fact, that even as monthly starter home costs increased in many of the markets that favored buying, rents for a similar-sized unit were 20% higher.\u201d\nThe Realtor.com report compared the cost to purchase a home with the cost of rent across the 50 largest cities nationwide. In 26 of these locations, buying a home was cheaper than renting. On average, buying a home in these areas was more than 20% cheaper than renting, in terms of the monthly expenses.\nThe best place to buy, rather than rent, was Birmingham, Ala., where households stood to save more than 44% on their housing costs if they bought a home. Realtor.com calculated the cost to purchase a home in each market by averaging the median list prices for homes of different sizes and assuming that the buyer brought a 7% down payment and had a mortgage charging 3.45% interest. The housing costs also factor in taxes, insurance and homeowners\u2019 association dues.\n \u201cIn Austin, Texas, buying a home involved monthly costs that were 76% higher than the median rent.\u201d \nOverall, most markets where buying was most affordable were \u201csecondary\u201d cities \u2014 locations with smaller populations, mostly across the South and Midwest. Other cities where buying was vastly more affordable than renting included Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Detroit.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, renters are the ones saving money in \u201cBig Tech\u201d cities. Austin, Texas, earned the dubious distinction in Realtor.com\u2019s analysis of being the city where renting was the cheapest compared with buying property. Purchasing a home translated to a 76% higher monthly cost than renting there. Other cities where this was true included New York, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle.\n\u201cFor young Americans like Gen Z who may have moved home to save money during COVID, renting in a big tech city offers flexibility and relative affordability even as rents recover in these areas,\u201d Hale said.\nThe homeownership gap between white and Black Americans is growing, even as the overall homeownership rate has seen record increases. A new report from the National Association of Realtors found that the U.S. homeownership rate as of 2020 \u2014 the most recent year for which data was available \u2014 stood at 65.5%, representing a 1.3% increase from the previous year.\nBut the homeownership rate among Black Americans was only 43.4%, and is still lower than its prior peak of 44.2% back in 2010. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate for Hispanic Americans hit 51.1%, surpassing the 50% mark for the first time on record. Among white Americans, the homeownership rate is above 72%.\n\u201cAs the gap in homeownership rates for Black and White Americans has widened, it is important to understand the unique challenges that minority home buyers face,\u201d Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at the National Association of Realtors, said in the report.\n\u201cHousing affordability and low inventory has made it even more challenging for all buyers to enter into homeownership, but even more so for Black Americans,\u201d Lautz added.\nA variety of factors represent roadblocks for Black Americans looking to achieve homeownership. Half of Black Americans who rent spend over 30% of their income on housing \u2014 and over a quarter of Black renter households are severely cost-burdened, spending more than half of their monthly income on rent. Comparatively, only 20% of White renter households were severely cost-burdened.\n \u201c\u2018 Housing affordability and low inventory has made it even more challenging for all buyers to enter into homeownership, but even more so for Black Americans.\u2019\u201d \nIncome is one factor that explains these gaps. Based on median income alone, around 47% of white renter households can qualify to buy a home, according to the Realtors report, versus just 36% of their Black peers.\nAdditionally, Black households were far more likely to hold student-loan debt. This was true of two in five Black households, versus roughly one in five white households.\n\u201cThis makes it difficult for Black households to save for a down payment and as a result, they often use their 401(k) or retirement savings to enter homeownership,\u201d Lautz said.\nSo long as Black families face these and other barriers to homeownership \u2014 Black and Hispanic applicants are more likely to be rejected for mortgages than their white neighbors \u2014 they will not only be subject to surging rents, but also have fewer opportunities to grow their wealth. An analysis from title insurance company First American FAF, +3.16% found that the median homeowner has 40 times the wealth of someone who rents their house, underscoring how homeownership remains the primary path toward growing wealth for most Americans."

The most commonly cited roadblocks: concerns about finding a new house and paying too much for a new house.\nIt\u2019s true that finding a home and especially finding one that fits all of your needs is a challenge right now. Competition over the few homes on the market is driving prices up. It\u2019s taking multiple offers and sometimes a hot tip on a house\u00a0not yet listed\u00a0to close a deal. However, current owners have an edge. By making the most of the market on the seller side, they\u2019ll enter the buyer side with more money to fuel their buying power.\nInventory is so low, there are likely multiple buyers looking for a home like yours right now.\nIn 2019, there were 1.3 million homes on the market in any given month, on average. By 2021, the number of active listings had fallen by 57%, to 540,000 on average, according to NerdWallet\u2019s analysis of Realtor.com data. There was already a home shortage before the pandemic, but COVID-19 took a bad situation and made it worse. Now, homes are selling within days, not weeks or months, and commanding multiple competitive offers. That demand shows few signs of letting up.\nNearly 26 million Americans say they plan to buy a home this year, according to the Home Buyer Report. That number is unrealistic \u2014 typically 5 million to 6 million homes are sold each year \u2014 but it does indicate the flood of buyers isn\u2019t likely to subside.\nBe sure to read: \u2018The major question is whether rising rates will quench housing demand\u2019: Existing-home sales surge higher, but could be set for a downturn\nHigh demand in the face of low supply has made for record high prices. This means you\u2019re more likely to pay off your current mortgage and walk away with a profit than you would\u2019ve been just a few years ago.\nHomes are also being listed at higher prices, and selling at or above asking price. In fact, buyers typically paid 100% of the list price in 2021, and 29% paid more than list price. While the sales price represents your ultimate financial benefit, getting offers over what you expect brings added excitement to the transaction.\nTypical sale prices grew from $270,000 on average in 2019, before the pandemic, to $344,000 in 2021, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. And in some places, they\u2019ve grown even more.\nAbout three-quarters (74%) of sellers did not have to reduce their asking price at all in 2021, compared with 60% in 2019 and 39% a decade ago in 2011, according to NerdWallet\u2019s analysis. The analysis covered 10 years of data from the NAR\u2019s annual Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers report.\nSee: Mortgage rates approach 4%, threatening to pour cold water on housing market\nBuying or selling a home is never a stress-free transaction, but selling now is far easier than in recent years. Not only do you stand to have multiple competitive offers, but you\u2019re also more likely to cruise through closing with fewer frustrations.\nIn 2021, homes were typically on the market for a single week, compared with 3 weeks in 2019, and 11 weeks in 2012 and 2013, according to our analysis of NAR data.\nIt\u2019s relatively common for sellers to do some wheeling and dealing during the closing process \u2014 offering a warranty or money for repairs to the buyer, for instance. But those perks have become less common.\nAlmost three-fourths of sellers didn\u2019t offer any incentives to attract buyers in 2021, compared to about 60% 10 years ago, according to our analysis of NAR data. The share of those offering a home warranty fell from 23% to 13% during that same period, and the share of sellers assisting with closing costs fell from 20% to 9%.\nClosing on a home sale can leave you with lessons learned, if not regrets. But in this market, that\u2019s less likely. Seven in 10 (70%) sellers walked away from the home selling process \u201cvery satisfied\u201d in 2021. A decade ago, just 54% could say the same, according to NAR data.\nAlso read: \u2018We live 5 minutes from our in-laws who have a larger home\u2019: Is it a good idea to swap houses? Will I end up with a surprise tax bill?\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking of selling, but are on the fence because you don\u2019t want to join the competitive pool of buyers, consider these questions:\nIf yes, the profits from your sale will go further in a less competitive market. Not everyone wants to move to a rural setting (like I did), but your offers will be more attractive to sellers in areas where demand isn\u2019t as hot. You\u2019ll be able to make a larger down payment and possibly reduce your new mortgage\u2019s term, both of which stand to save you considerably over the long term.\nIf yes, it\u2019s perfectly fine to go back to renting, or move in with someone else who has a deed or a mortgage. Owning a home isn\u2019t for everyone, and it doesn\u2019t have to be forever. Further, owning a home can be expensive \u2014 1 in 5 homeowners say affording home repairs and maintenance is among their top financial stressors for the next two years, according to the NerdWallet 2022 Home Buyer Report.\nIf yes, you\u2019re more likely to have what it takes to be a buyer in today\u2019s market. Finding a house you like will take time, and you might have to make offers on several homes before you go under contract. Being tenacious and knowing what challenges await you can better equip you for the potential battle ahead.\nMore From NerdWallet\nElizabeth Renter writes for NerdWallet.

We have between 40% and 50% equity in the property due to a large down payment.\nWe live five minutes from our in-laws who have a larger home (around 2,250 square feet) that they bought in 1991 for $450,000. They have seven years left on their mortgage. They are in their 70s and will be downsizing in the next eight to 12 years.\nOur hope is to \u201cswap\u201d homes with them. We will be looking for more space around the same time that they will need a single-level, smaller property. What is the best way to arrange for this with minimal tax implications?\nSincerely,\nSweet on Swapping\n\u2018The Big Move\u2019 is a MarketWatch column looking at the ins and outs of real estate, from navigating the search for a new home to applying for a mortgage.\nDo you have a question about buying or selling a home? Do you want to know where your next move should be? Email Jacob Passy at\u00a0TheBigMove@marketwatch.com.\nIf only more people could find themselves in scenarios where swapping or trading a home were feasible. In the height of the Great Recession, the question of whether you could merely swap homes with someone was asked a lot. Back then, many homeowners found themselves underwater on their homes \u2014 owing more to their mortgage lender than the property was worth. That made it difficult to move, because selling the home alone wouldn\u2019t clear the mortgage for these homeowners.\nSo many folks tried to find people willing to swap homes \u2014 enabling them to cut each other deals to make buying and selling a bit easier. Arguably, the strategy is gaining popularity again. Some iBuying companies have programs where you can sell your home to them and then buy one of the homes they\u2019re selling, which promises to make the process cheaper and more flexible.\nIndeed many homeowners today might prefer to sell and move if it were that simple. But because there are so few homes on the market, they\u2019re hesitant to do so. I myself have friends who sold their homes because their families grew, but were essentially forced to rent because they couldn\u2019t find an affordable home for sale.\nSwapping homes has other benefits besides taking the guesswork out of the process. You don\u2019t need to hire real-estate agents and can save on commissions. And in your case, you might be able to save on the home inspection, even, assuming you\u2019re well informed on the state of your in-laws\u2019 home. So I don\u2019t blame you for dreaming of this possibility.\nAssuming your in-laws are game \u2014 and, please, be gentle in proposing this idea to them \u2014 you\u2019ll want to hire attorneys and accountants who can guide you through the process. Because as you already guessed, there are multiple tax-related pitfalls you\u2019ll need to avoid.\nBecause you live in California, one of your primary concerns no doubt is the property-tax situation. Before February 2021, the assessed value of a home for property-tax purposes could pass from parent to child when the home transferred between the two. In other words, if a child bought or inherited a home from their parents, they could retain the original property-tax basis. That can represent significant savings, because homes are normally reassessed between owners. In the case of a family home that\u2019s been owned for generations, the value today is likely much, much higher than it was when it was first purchased.\nCalifornia\u2019s Proposition 19, which went into effect last February, changed that. While it allowed older or disabled homeowners or people displaced by natural disasters to transfer their existing tax-assessed value to a new home even if it was more expensive, it limited the ability to transfer such tax benefits among family members.\n\u201cThe Prop. 19 rules say that you can pass a principal residence to your children, so long as it was the primary residence of the parents before, and it\u2019s the primary residence of the child thereafter,\u201d Yin Ho, a California-based partner at international law firm Withers who specializes in real-estate law, told MarketWatch in December.\nNormally, this transfer occurs via inheritance, but according to the County of Santa Clara Assessor\u2019s Office, it also applies when a parent sells a home to a child (and vice versa). Because both of the homes in question here are primary residences, you should be in the clear.\nHowever, you won\u2019t just keep your in-law\u2019s current tax rate. Rather, a property assessor will determine its current value. If the value at the time of the transfer is less than $1 million greater than the original assessed value, the home will retain that value. From what you\u2019ve described, I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s not the case.\n \u201cUnder Proposition 19, an assessor will determine the current value of a home to determine if the person it was transferred to must pay a higher tax rate.\u201d \nSo for your in-laws\u2019 house, the property will likely be reassessed, but you will get to exclude $1 million from the reassessed value. The exclusion must be claimed at the time of purchase or within a year, according to the San Joaquin County Bar Association.\nWhat that means is if the home\u2019s new value is $2 million, your property-tax base would be $1 million after the exclusion. Therefore, you should keep that in mind when approaching this swap, especially if you wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the property taxes.\nAdditionally, there capital gains and gift taxes to consider. The Internal Revenue Service will take a keen interest in a situation like this where high-valued real estate is being transferred among family. Consequently, you\u2019ll need to ensure that everything is done by the book so as to not run afoul of the law and be accused of trying to avoid the capital-gains tax.\nAlong those lines, when you say you want to \u201cswap\u201d homes, you\u2019ll need to decide whether that means gifting the homes to each other or selling them. And if you sell them, keep in mind \u2014 any amount below the fair market value can be considered a gift. If you sell the homes to each other for less than they are worth, you\u2019ll need to report the gift to the IRS if the difference in value is greater than $16,000. The lifetime gift tax exclusion, as of 2021, was $11.7 million. You wouldn\u2019t pay any taxes on any gifts made until that amount was reached.\nI don\u2019t know your or your in-laws\u2019 full financial picture, but given that you\u2019re discussing transferring millions of dollars\u2019 worth of real estate, you should consider the tax implications of anything you gift to one another \u2014 be it property or money.\nAs I said before, hiring accountants and attorneys will be crucial to ensure that any property transfer happens smoothly. With those professionals in place, you\u2019ll also reduce the chance of hurt feelings if any aspects of the deal become complicated. And keep in mind, your in-laws may have opinions about what you do with the house. So make sure you\u2019re on the same page about this before you move forward. You wouldn\u2019t want your mother-in-law to get upset over repainting a beloved mural, or putting carpet over the hardwood floor she preserved for decades.\nI recognize that you\u2019re not planning to trade homes anytime soon either. In the end, you may find it\u2019s better to go the traditional route.\nBy emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on MarketWatch.\u00a0By submitting your story to Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of MarketWatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties."
